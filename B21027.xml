            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee read of a Gentleman that had two friends, with vvhom for a long time vvas all his converſation, ioy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but being at lenght con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to part company, yet in his abſence hee ſtill continued his former loue vvith them; and to this purpoſe ſent them daylie his letters, meſſages, gifts, &amp; preſents; &amp; his friends as often repayed him vvith great thankes and gratitude, both equally extolling his liberality, ſetting forth the magnificency of his preſents, and wishing they vvere able in the leaſt meaſure to requite him: but yet vvith this difference (as appeared by their letters, and the Gentleman at lenght clearely perceiued) that the one of them in his anſwers vvas totally pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out in the prayſes of the preſents ſent him, ſetting them out for the moſt rare, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and moſt vvelc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me to him, that no expref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion could ſufficiently declare, how he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them; next he returned the Gentleman a thouſand moſt humble ſincere &amp; cordiall than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, for his loue &amp; fauours; &amp; finally offered him (&amp; this moſt vnfainedly) a thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of his gratitude &amp; loyall ſeruice: but in
<pb facs="tcp:200342:4"/>all this not one vvord of any deſire, wish, or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging he had for his ſpeedy returne. Whereas the other friend, though he omitted it not, yet vvas he briefer in the like expreſſion of the value and eſteem of the preſents, of his thankes, gratitude &amp; ſeruice, &amp;c. but to ſignifie the other point of the deſires, the longings, the deaths he ſuffered for the long abſence of his friend, all time vvas too short, all paper too little.</p>
            <p>He asked him an hundred times ouer &amp; ouer, how many vveekes, dayes or houres it would be till he returned: that, if he had time for it, he vvould ſend him vvord, vvhether &amp; vvhen he should come forth to meet him: or rather that he vvould make ſuch ſpeed himſelfe, that all meſſages more might be preuented: finally that he liued in the meane vvhile onely vpon his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, for the preſeruing &amp; refreshing of which &amp; for no other end or content he had in them, he daylie and hourely read ouer the letters, and reuiewed the gifts he had ſo oft receiued from him: but alâs being but poore shadovvs vvithout ſubſtance they could not continue life; &amp; that therefore nothing but his ovvne preſence, &amp; that ſpeedy too, could eaſe his griefe or giue him content &amp; reſt. The Gentleman, as I ſayd, well perceiued this difference of affections in his friends; &amp; that the one ſeemed to loue his gifts, the other his perſon: yet to make a reall triall of both, he ſuddenly &amp; vnlooked-for returneth home, &amp; going ſeuerally to viſit his friends, he findeth them both looking ouer the letters, and vnfolding the tokens he had formerly ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:

Novv, like the aboue ſayd Gentleman, he findeth amongſt vs tvvo ſort of friends: for ſome (hovv nigh might I ſay, all?) looke ſo much vpon the bleſſings they enioy, vvhether temporall or ſpirituall; take ſuch notice and content in the comfort, and devotion they fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in prayer, holy Scriptures, &amp; deuout bookes, that thinking themſelues now full of pietie, and happineſſe, they neuer caſt vp an eye, a thought, a ſigh tovvards their abſent friend: neuer long for his ſvveet preſence; neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne him their thankes and duty for himſelfe theſe are clearely conuicted not to loue God, ſo much for himſelfe, as for his gifts; nor to reſpect his honour, vvill, and pleaſure, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ovvne profit and content. Wherefore let ſuch be ſure, they shall neuer enjoy Gods ſpeciall, &amp; as I may call them, perſonall viſits; nor haue the comfort and revvard of a true louer.</p>
            <p>But the true friend &amp; louer of God indeed (I dare hardly put him in the plurall number,
<pb facs="tcp:200342:5"/>
               <hi>Ne ille vnicus ſit, Least there be none but him,</hi>) proceedeth after another manner: he omitteth not to thinke &amp; run inate on the doctrine &amp; commands his Lord hath left among vs, and ſerueth them moſt exactly; he letteth not a day, nor ſcarce an houre paſſe, vvithout a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der remembrance of the bitter death &amp; paſſion he ſuffered for vs: he looketh full often vpon the preſents his louing Lord daylie ſendeth him, that is, meditateth with loue and gratitude vpon the innumera le benefits of all ſorts shovvred dovvne vpon vs all: nay as often readeth ouer his kindeſt letters of holy Scriptures &amp; pious bookes.

               <p>According to theſe three Eſtates or wayes to perfection, the generall matters of Meditation may be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into three ſorts; To beginners in the purgative way, may be aſſigned for matter of Meditation, the true knowledge of themſelues and their nothing; the grievouſnes and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſinne: the miſeries incident to mans life; the foure laſt thing of man, to witt, death, judgement particular and vniverſall, hell and heauen; all which are fit to engender a feare of God, the beginning of wiſedome, and

               <p>To the Proficients in the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way may be appointed all the Theologicall and Morall vertues, or rather all the Myſteries of our B. Sauiour his life, paſſion and death, in which all vertues, not in ſpeculative definitions, but practicall examples, shine as in their fount or firſt origen. Finally to the perfect, in the vnitive way, may be propoſed the glorious myſteries of our B. Sauiour after his triumph ouer death, together with thoſe of the B. Virgin his Mother; next the divine perfections of the Godhead in it ſelfe, as well affirmatively as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively; laſtly the divine benefits beſtowed on man and other creatures, all motives to a perfect vnion of loue.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 COnſider firſt, theſe words of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <hi>Formauit Deus hominem de limo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; God formed man of the ſlyme of the earth.</hi> The earth is the loweſt and baſeſt of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:200342:15"/>Elements, euer trodden and trampled with the feet of men and beaſts; but mud, ſlime, or clay is ſo low and foule, as both men and beaſts flie and auoyde it, knowing how euery light touch thereof defileth: yet of this earth, of this clay, how foule, how ſlimy ſoeuer, are formed and framed the talleſt, the ſtouteſt, and moſt beautifull bodies of the greateſt Monarchs, and Ladies of the world: nay durt and clay are more noble, then ſuch bodies, if antiquity be a ſigne of nobility: <hi>Vt quid ſuperbis puluis &amp; cinis? vt quid ſuperbis? vvhy art thou proud thou duſt and ashes: vvhy art thou proud?</hi> be ashamed, ſeing all the world knoweth thy beginning, be as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med I ſay, to carry thy ſelfe ſo bigge, ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didous, as if no leſſe then gold and precious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were the ingredients of thy being: paint it ouer as much as thou pleaſeſt, it is but earth, but durt and ſlime: vnleſſe thou will perhaps ſay; tis true, Adam was no better, being framed of the clay of the earth; but I not ſoe, being begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of another fashion, and complexion: poore gallant, deceiue not thy ſelfe; for the manner of thy begetting is ſo foule that the name, nay the lighteſt thought of it, defileth the pureſt minde, ſo that our B. Sauiour refuſed none of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, but onely that; and the matter ſo horrid, ſo foule, that all other dung is pleaſant and gratefull in reſpect of it; nay we dare not in diſcourſe giue it a name, for our owne shame &amp; others offence.</p>
                  <p>Conclude hence with thy ſelfe neuer to boaſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:200342:15"/>nor grow proud of thy ſtrength, comelineſſe &amp; beauty, nor of thy ancient ſtock and nobility, ſince the ground worke of all is euer clay and durt, or if thou wilt needs ſtriue further, thou wilt find for the fountaine-head iuſt nothing, <hi>Nam ex nihilo omnia: for all are out of nothing.</hi> Hence beginne a true knowledge of thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, what mans body is in the wombe, in the cradle, and in the reſt of its life: I cannot imagine any priſon ſo darke, ſo ſtraight, ſo loathſome, as the wombe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in Which the child is incloſed, &amp; enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in moſt foule, bloudy and matterous skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or membranes, for no leſſe, then nine whole moneths; ſo ſtraighned &amp; preſſed, that neither hand nor foot can he ſtirre or moue: his food, the filthy menſtruous bloud of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a thing ſo naſty, and poiſonous, as that what ſoeuer it toucheth, it infecteth, like the plague or lepry; ſuch is his houſe, ſuch his diet. Now at his birth, ô how miſerable, how poore, how naked? couered onely with a thin but moſt foule and bloudy net; out of which being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſed, the firſt thing muſt be done, is to wash it, ere it can be well touched or viewed: and then ſo weake and ſeeble, that it can neither moue, not helpe it ſelfe; all that it can doe, is to cry and bewayle the generall miſerie of man kind; and in this eſtate, accompanied with a thouſand more miſeries, and dangers, it paſſeth its cradle &amp; infancie. Being growne vp to mans eſtate, I will grant it thee, let it be the ſtrongeſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:200342:16"/>faireſt, and beſt tempered body, thou wilt or canſt imagine (which yet is granted to verie few) thou shalt find it but a painted wall, or a ſepulcher pargetted with chalke, white without, but within more ſtinking, then any dunghill, more foule, then any puddle; witnes the filth, that continually flowes from all its conduits &amp; pores, witnes the ſweeteſt meats, no ſooner, eaten, then turned to the loathſomeſt froth or ordure in the world &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Conclude as formerly a true iudgement of what thou art, and imprint it ſo in thy mind, that it may euer check all riſing fancies to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly the condition of mans body after death; the ſoule being once departed, behold how pale, how ſtarke, how grieſely the body remaineth, how gallant and faire ſoeuer it formerly had beene; a man can hardly ſee or touch it without a certaine horrour of mind: no ſooner ſtiffe and cold but preſently it beginnes to corrupt &amp; ſmell, hence is that great haſt and buſtling of its deareſt friends and kindred, to heaue it ſoone out of doore, and lay it low vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, for feare of infecting the aire, and cauſing peſtilence; whereas a dunghill may lie for weekes behind the doore without offence, and in the ſtreets a dead dog or cat without much annoyance. Conſider now the graue, its ſecond wombe; ſome what larger, I confeſſe, then the former, but in other reſpects I ſee no great choice; as darke, as foule, as that, beſides
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200342:16"/>ſwarmes of wormes &amp; maggots for our reſtles bedfellowes: ô were it but opened after ſome twenty dayes, what a ſight, what a ſent should we haue; let him, that can, expreſſe it. It is ſayd that a certaine Tyrant tyed dead bodies to the quicke for a torment': ſurely he was Maſter in that blacke art, for the embracements of ſnakes, and the kiſſes of toades are farre more tolerable, then thoſe of mans carcaſſe halfe corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Conclude, neither to eſteeme, nor pamper thy body, ſincé it is all at laſt but foôd for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: remember allwayes the words of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mother the Church; <hi>Memento homo quod puluis es, &amp; in puluerem reuerteris: Remember ô man, that thou art duſt, &amp; into duſt thou shalt returne.</hi> If duſt be my beginning, and duſt my end, what doe I deceiue my ſelfe or others, as though I carried about mee ſome rich cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of pearles, or pretious ſtones? when being opened, I am found ſo ſtinking a puddle.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, how that, if thy body were originally clay and durt, thy ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God created it, was iuſt nothing, that is, a pure priuation of all being, and of all thoſe things which accompany a being: ô who can deſcribe vnto mee, what or where this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is? It is neither in heauen, hell, nor earth,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200342:17"/>nor in any of the vnknowne worlds; it differs more from the leaſt ſand, the leaſt moat in the ſunne, then the heauens vaſt orbes from an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot, then the infinity of God from the leaſt of his creatures, for here at leaſt we find ſomething to ground a compariſon; but nothing? good Lord what can be made of it, but iuſt nothing? vnleſſe thy omnipotent hand deſcend power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into its abyſſe, and draw thence this my ſoule into a noble, ſpirituall, and intellectuall ſubſtance, little leſſe then the Angelicall, nay repreſenting thy owne immenſe Eſſence? but couldeſt thou merit or procure this thy being from his hand? ô nothing leſſe, for nothing can ſay and doe nothing: it was his gratious bounty and liberality, that freely beſtowed this being vpon thee, otherwiſe thou wouldeſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for all eternitie as thou waſt, nothing; nay should God but for one minute withdraw from thee his conſeruing hand, in that very ſame inſtant wouldeſt thou fade away into thy owne habitation of nothing: bragge hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vaine man of nothing, but thy owne, that is, of thy nothing in being, &amp; againe vanishing into nothing.</p>
                  <p>Conclude and ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Quid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, quod non accepisti, ſi autem acceperis, quid gloriaris?

                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly how true that ſentence of the Wiſeman is; <hi>Corpus, quod corrumpitur, aggrauat animam, &amp; terrena inhabitatio depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſenſum multa cogitantem: the bodie, that is corrupted burdeneth the ſoule, &amp; the earthlie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation preſſeth dovvne the vnderſtanding, that thinketh many things.</hi> And marke how many wayes this is true; firſt, at her firſt vnion with the body shee is defiled &amp; ſpotted with originall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; ſo ſubiect to all the miſeries both te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall, &amp; eternall, which ſpring from that ſource: then for the firſt eight or nine yeares, in what, J pray, doth the ſoule of a child differ from that of a beaſt, in any exteriour action or diſcourſe? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that pretious iewell obtained, the vſe of reaſon; who is able to recount the darknes, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and errours of our vnderſtanding? the backwardnes of our will to good, &amp; proneneſſe to ill? the diſtractions and failings of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? the tempeſtuous ſtormes &amp; conflicts of the inferiour powers, both iraſcible and concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible? and the poore ſoule, like a boat betwixt two waues, toſſed and beaten from the one to the other, from loue to hatred, from hope to feare, from ioy to griefe, from anger to puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie &amp;c. hardly ſettled or quiet for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and theſe waues of paſſions bring her at laſt, not to know what shee would haue; this euery one will feele in him ſelfe, more or leſſe, if he will ſincerely examîne and ponder his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſitions and daylie inclinations, hither and thither.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:200342:18"/>
                  <p> Conclude and frame a true conceit of the ſtate and condition of thy poore ſoule, dwelling in the midſt of ſo much ignorance, and amongſt ſo many paſſions all violently drawing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way: then humble thy ſelfe before the diuine maieſty, and begge of him, <hi>Vt imperet fluctibus, &amp; mari &amp; fiat tranquillitas magna; that he vvould command the vvaues and the ſea, and that there might enſue a great calme.</hi> That the poore paſſenger our ſoule, perish not at laſt in ſoe terrible and neuer-ceaſing ſtormes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly the miſerable condition of a ſoule, ouer which the beaſtly luſt of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall part hath once gotten the dominion; how she is led in fetters from ſinne to ſinne, from luſt to luſt, contrary to her owne actuall reaſon and iudgement; nay often with a certaine abhorring and griefe, to doe what shee is compelled vnto, to goe whether shee is dragged by her ſlauish, but now all-maſtering appetites: ſo that there is verified, what S. Paul ſayth; <hi>non quod volo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, hoc ago, ſed quod odi malum, illud facio. Not the good vvhich J vvill, the ſame doe I, but the ill vvhich I hate, that I doe.</hi> O moſt deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition! haue you ſeene or heard of a Lady, noble, beauteous, rich, heire apparent to her fathers kingdome, deliuered ouer to a ſlauish varlet, to be commanded, domineered &amp; croſſed in euery thing, nay bound and dragged by her ſlaue, to vvhat shee moſt abhorreth and hateth? truely I haue neuer heard of the like caſe: and yet ſo it paſſeth with a poore ſoule, once giuen ouer to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:200342:18"/>her paſſions, a noble ſpirit, faire as the Angells, marked with the character of God, heire to the kingdome of heauen, ſubiected to a baſe, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and hellish ſlauery. <hi>O quis me liberabit de carcere corporis huius? O vvho shal deliuer me from the priſon of this bodie.</hi> This is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſoule, comming into this houſe of clay; and this is her liuing in it: but vvhen she muſt goe forth againe, vvhat thinke you then? vvhat griefe, to be plucked from her old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion the body, and together from all her old acquaintance and commodities of this vvorld? and vvhat a ſtrangeneſſe, to vvander into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, an vnheard of Region? but vvhat a horrour to be preſented to the iudgement ſeat? vvhat trembling at ſo heauy an accuſation of all her life? and vvhat anguish in expecting, vvhat the doome and ſentence vvill be? if at length it come of eternall damnation, vvhat then, ſad vvretch? vvhat then, poore caytife?</p>
                  <p>Conclude to looke about, vvhile time ſerues, and firſt to regaine the dominion ouer our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; next vvith humble feare to ſecure our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: for vvhat greater folly, then not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for a certaine danger?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly, or rather conclude out of the former conſiderations, both of thy body and ſoule, both their beginning &amp; ending; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude I ſay, and ſettle vvith thy ſelfe, once for all, a true, ſincere, and cleare knowledge of thy ſelfe: for reſt moſt aſſured, that this knowledge is the onely ground and foundation of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:200342:19"/>life; the readieſt vvay to know God, and the moſt efficacious meanes to loue him; and the vvant of it, the high vvay to all perdition: ſettle therefore firſt vvith thy ſelfe this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that by thy body ſide thou art originally clay, then a painted maſſe or muck hill, laſtly a companion and food of vvormes; and by thy ſoules ſide, firſt iuſt nothing, <hi>priuatio entis; a priuation of being.</hi> Next defiled vvith ſinne; and ſubiect to moſt ſlauish paſſions; laſtly God knowes, vvhat her lot and deſtinie vvill bé. Hauing thus humbly, yet truely iudged of thy ſelfe; next, deſire or at leaſt ſuffer all others to thinke &amp; iudge the ſame of thee: for it vvere great folly, nay hypocriſie, to deſire all men, to thinke and ſpeake as vvee doe in other matters, and in this onely to bee of a different opinion, both of vvhat vvee are, and vvhat vve eſteeme our ſelues: doe therefore this, and thou haſt gotten true humility; that is, a true knowledge of thy owne baſenes, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that all others should, know and vote thee for ſuch: &amp; ſo art thou armed to double proofe; firſt againſt all invvard rebellion of pride, vaine glorie and ſelfe conceit, vvith a, <hi>Quid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes quod non accepiſti; vvhat haſt thou that thou haſt not receiued?</hi> Next, againſt all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſaults, both of flatterie and contempt; for neither can others contempt depreſſe thee below vvhat thou art, nor their praiſe and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie raiſe thee, to vvhat thou art not. And this humilitie is the more ſolid, becauſe common
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:200342:19"/>to all creatures, being grounded not on ſinne, or other caſuall imperfections; but vpon the pure and ſimple nothing of ourſelues, and the all things, vve haue from God: this therefore humility, the Saints, the Angells, the Virgin Mary, nay our B.

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt both the shortnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainety of mans life: make the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a hundred yeares (and yet not one in a hundred thouſand doth attaine thither) vvhat is that compared to Eternitie? not ſo much as a moment, or the twinkling of an eye; looke backe on vvhat is paſſed, and thou vvilt ſcarce find a dreame, a shadow: but ſtay; out of theſe hundred yeares, vve muſt yet cut of a large share, firſt the time of childhood, vvherein it cannot bee ſayd, vvee liue like men: then the time of ſleepe, a full third part vvith moſt men, of the ſayd hundred; next vve may vvell cut of the latter part of old age alſo, vvhich is not <hi>vita, life;</hi> but <hi>labor labour,</hi> and <hi>dolor, griefe;</hi> and <hi>ſenex an old man:</hi> you know is <hi>bis puer: vvice at child:</hi> J dare not diſcount all the time vvhich is comonly loſt or ill ſpent, leaſt J
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200342:20"/>should leaue nothing, and yet it may very vvell bee done. The Wiſe man compareth it to a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to a poſt riding by, to a ship vnder full ſaile, to a bird vpon the vving, to an arrow from the bow; <hi>Sic &amp; nos nati continuò deſiuimus eſſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude therefore to play both a good Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. and a good ſouldier: a good merchant in prouiding rather for Eternitie, then for this preſent moment: a good ſouldier, in keeping a vigilant ſentinell vpon this our Caſtle, leaſt the enemie aſſayle vs, as commonly he doth, vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvares, or a ſleep: ô take heed, for on this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depends Eternitie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the frailtie of our life, noe glaſſe more brickle, no flovver ſooner bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: a cold, a vvind, a vvarme Sunne, the pricke of a pin, the bite of a vvorme, a great griefe, nay the exceſſe of a ſudden ioy are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take avvay the breath and life of the ſtrongeſt man in the vvorld: hovv oft doe vvee heare this and that man ſuddenly fallen dead? or going healthy and ſound to bed, found in the morning vvithout life or motion? and yet noe skill of Phyſitians can tell hovv, nor vvhy?

                  <p n="3">3.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:200342:21"/>meates oppreſſe, faſting quaileth, ſports diſſolue, ſadnes conſumeth, cares rend aſunder, quiet ſecurity deſtroyeth, riches puffe vp, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty abateth; youth lifts on high, old age boweth downe, infirmity breaketh: and after all this, what ſucceeds, but furious death, the full point and period of all her delights? ſo that fitly may it be tearmed, a liuing death, or a dying life.

So that it is a common phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Scripture, to terme ſinners the enemies of God, and God their enemy; what can be more fearfull and terrible, then for a poore caytife to haue omnipotent majeſtie his angred enemy? &amp; conſequently all creatures both of heauen and earth, moſt ready and forward to take reuenge of their Creatours wrong, and nothing, but a becke of his is wanting, to put it in ſudden exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; according to that: <hi>Et pugnabit cum illo

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, what a ſoule doth looſe by a mortall ſinne; to wit, the grace and friendship of Almighty God, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, an ineſtimable treaſure; and faith and hope, which remaine, lie dead, void and vnprofitable. She loſeth the title of the daughter of God; the fatherly protection, that he hath of the iuſt; the title &amp; right to the kingdome of heauen; the gracious robe of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie with which the holy Ghoſt had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted her.

                  <p>Conclude with a ſtrong hatred againſt ſinne: for ſeeing, that all creatures doe naturally hate that, which hurteth or wrongeth them, is it not great reaſon, that man abhorre the monſter of ſinne? which is onely able to bereaue him of his laſt end, and eternall felicitie; a dammage, which all the world beſide cannot doe him.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:200342:31"/>but not ſure of the pardon.

Finally a ſinne ſeldome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh alone, but bringeth others, either with it, or after it.</p>

                  <p n="4">4.

Ueniall ſinne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it deſtroy not charitie, yet it vveakeneth and cooleth the feruour, she other vviſe vvould shevv in all our actions: it is like a miſty &amp; darke ſome cloud, that obſcureth the brightnes, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and beauty of our ſoule: it hindreth the inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations of the holy Ghoſt from vvorking; it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:200342:32"/>dulleth the ſpirit and feruor of prayer; it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſoule feeble, drovvſie and in a certaine lethargy, benumming, as it vvere, her povvers and vitall parts.

So that, the houre will once come to me, that am now young, healthy and luſty, in which I muſt for euer bid adieu to this world &amp; all that is in it: once will the day come, whoſe night I shall neuer ſee; or the night, whoſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne will neuer shine vpon me. Neither can this day or night be farre of from the youngeſt of vs; for death comes by the poſt and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when leaſt expected: as the rich man in the Goſpell, hauing hoarded vp for many yeares, &amp; intending nothing but a merry life; receiued ſuddenly the ſad tydings, <hi>Stulte, nocte hac ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam tua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repetent à te: thou foole, this night they shall require thy ſoule of thee.</hi> Death therefore is

O how diſaſtrous &amp; dangerous are theſe ſudden claps! But ſuppoſe thy good hap bring thee to thy bed, with the aſſiſtance of thy friends, the ſuccour of Phyſitians &amp; the comfort of the holy Sacraments (for neuer hope to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this) canſt thou yet tell me what thy infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie will be? whether long or short? gentle or sharpe? cleanly or noyſome? bereauing thee of thy wits, or giuing thee time and abilitie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thy ſoule, eſtate and familie? nothing leſſe; no ſtrength, no riches, no wit or learning, can helpe any man to the knowledge of the leaſt of theſe.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, the condition of mans body after the ſoule hath left it; dead, ſtiffe, cold, pale, vgly, heauy as a logge; haſting ſo faſt to corruption, that the great haſt the beſt friends make to heaue it out of doore, can hardly preuent a ſenſible ſtench &amp; ill ſmell: finally ſo horrid, that not many are to be found,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:200342:37"/>who dare ſleep a night, I will not ſay, in the ſame bed with it, but in the ſame roome onely: and wee read of a tyrant that ioyned dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the quick, for the greateſt torment hee could inuent. But how is it treated by its deareſt friends, father, mother, vvife, or child? a teare or two may be shed out of tenderneſſe, but moſt commonly for fashion or proper intereſt; and preſently a graue made, a vvinding sheet, and it may be a coffin prepared; carried out of doores, layed in the hole, the earth vell trodden and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dovvne: a <hi>requieſcat, God haue mercie on his ſoule:</hi> and <hi>a dios: a dieu.</hi> And who hath more than this? now in the grave, vvhat companions, but ſwarms of maggotts and wormés what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but of a loathſome corruption? and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally what end, but of earth and duſt, from whence it came?</p>
                  <p>Conclude with a true deſire of mortification and pouerty: to vvhat purpoſe are riches and brauery, vvhereas a poore sheet muſt be our laſt liuery?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the body and ſoule now parted &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling diuers wayes, according to their nature: the body immediatly tendeth to corruption; but the ſoule remaineth eternally, as long, as God shall be God: the body dead &amp; vncapable of ioy or paine; but the ſoule capable of both, and ſure of one for all eternitie, the body is carried to the graue, vvell accompanied vvith kindred and friends; but here the ſoule is forſaken of all; and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200342:37"/>poore ſilly creature is to vvander all alone through darkſome and vnknowne Regions, &amp; euery where beſett &amp; rounded vvith moſt cruell and fierce high vvay-robbers, to vvit legions of deuills the inhabitants of thoſe fearefull shades. O vvhat vvould the poore ſoule then giue for a good and faithfull guide, &amp; tvvo or three good companions to aſſiſt her? tis true, she neuer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the preſence of her good Angell; but alás! that vvill comfort her but little, vnleſſe her other company be futable, to wit her workes &amp; deeds done in this life; if theſe be good; ô then she paſſeth merrily vnder the vving of her Guardian but if bad, then all is eternally loſt.</p>
                  <p>Conclude ſeriouſly to prouide good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt that ſad time, &amp; haue a care to shake of ill company in time: next labour to make friends, the B. Uirgin, thy good Angell, and other Patrons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, the great difference that is betwixt the death of the iuſt, and that of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: of theſe it is ſayd, <hi>mors peccatorum peſſima: the death of ſinners is verie ill:</hi> but of thoſe; <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſa in conſpectu Domini mors Sanctorum eius: Precious in the ſight of our lord is the death of his ſaints.</hi> A ſinner at that houre hath all the afore ſayd cauſes of feare, without any ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or eaſe: and I ſpeake not onely of great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of vvhom vve may ſay, <hi>Quod iam iudicati ſunt; that they are allreadie iudged.</hi> Whoſe caſe is totally deſperate and terrible; but of weake and feeble Chriſtians alſo; ſuch as the world is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:200342:38"/>full of: vvhat feares, doubts, and tremblings vvill theſe ſuffer, whether they shall be ſaued or no; ô what would they giue for a little ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity? but ſuppoſe they haue this; then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they fall into the moſt vnſufferable paines of Purgatorie, vntill the laſt farthing be payd: and ô Lord how long will that be?

                  <head>THE FOVRTH MEDITATION. <hi>Of the particular Iudgement after death.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that the greateſt terrour of death ariſeth not ſo much from death it ſelfe, as from the iudgement, that followeth at its heeles: the time therefore of this iudgement is the firſt inſtant or moment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſoule is parted from the body: in vvhich the vvhole cauſe is punctually and iuridically concluded and ſentenced, as if it vvere a proceſſe of a hundred yeares: vvherein the accuſer and accuſed shall ſtand at the barre; the charge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vp, the plea and anſwer receiued; proofes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, vvitneſſes examined, and a finall and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue doome and ſentence pronounced: and no vvonder, for the Judge is both omnipotent in power, and thence commandeth all at a beck; and alſo infinite in vviſedome, and hence ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the deepeſt ſecrets of hearts. The place of this iudgement is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly thought, to be that, vvherein a man dieth; ſo that God being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and euery vvhere, raiſeth in that very place his inuiſible ſeat, before vvhich the poore ſoule, ſcarce yet out of the body, ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
                  <p>Conclude hence tvvo things: the firſt a great feare and care of that moment, on vvhich eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie immediately dependeth, neuer to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, neuer recalled: the ſecond, that vvhereas men ordinarily die or may die in the houſe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:200342:39"/>chamber nay bed, vvhere they liue and ſleep; neuer to dare to commit any ſinne therein, but euer te looke on them, as the place of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: &amp; vvho dare offend at the barre?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, hovv ſuddenly the poore ſoule is bereaued and forſaken of all her friends; for all leaue her at deaths doore, none can goe to the barre vvith her; none there plead for her; onely her Angell-Guardian preſenteth her before the Iudge, and the Deuill preſently follovveth at her back; and layeth home her charge to the full, not ſparing the leaſt vvord, vvorke or thought of all her life; but charging &amp; exaggerating euery thing; and produceth two infallible vvitneſſes for vvhat hee ſayth, to vvit the Iudge himſelfe, the knovver of all ſecrets, &amp; the guilty conſcience of the ſoule accuſed: on the other ſide the good Angel pleadeth &amp; allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for her, vvhat poſſibly he can, as both the good vvorkes she hath done, as alſo the ſorrovv and repentance she hath had of her ſinnes. O! vvith vvhat anguiſh ſtandeth the poore creature expecting the eternall doome of miſerie, or happines? vvhat vvould she giue novv for a dramme of repentance, to giue a generall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver to the Deuills accuſations? and vvhat for a pound of good vvorkes for her Angell to bring in, and to vveigh dovvne the ſcale?</p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith a moſt ſerious and ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to ſett all things againſt this moment; firſt by croſſing the black booke of ſinne, by a true repentance &amp; confeſſion; next to augment
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:200342:39"/>and adde daylie to the booke of good vvorkes: <hi>Age, age nunc, chariſſime, quidquid agere potes: doe novv, my beloued Brother, doe novv vvhat thou thou canst.</hi> Quoth Thomas a Kempis.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, hovv terrible a thing it is, to enter into iudgement vvith God almighty, vvho is of infinite purity, ſanctitie, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: hence King Dauid cryed, out, <hi>Non intres in iudicium cum ſeruo tuo Domine, quia non iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficabitur, coram te omnis viuens: enter not into iudgement vvith thy ſeruant, becauſe noe man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing shall be iustified in thy ſight.</hi> hence S. Paul trembling ſayd; <hi>Nihil mihi conſcius ſum, ſed non in hoc iustificatus ſum, eſt enim Deus qui iudicat. I am not guiltie in conſcience of any thing: but I am not iuſtified herein, for he that iudgeth is god.</hi> For firſt the ſinnes vvhich vve account light, and moſt veniall, vvill appeare in the eyes of god, great, foule and hainous: doe not holy men here vvith vs eſteeme ſinnes great and heauy, vvhich vvordlings thinke either very ſmall, or nothing at all? doth not a curious paynter find a fault, a blemish, vvhere others thinke all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and compleat? vvhat eſtimation then, thinke vvee, vvill the infinite holines of God haue of the leaſt of our ſinnes? what ſpotts and defects will that diuine paynter finde in this our mould of clay and duſt? Next, he will ſift ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrovvly our iuſt &amp; good vvorkes, that very fevv of them will be found perfect and cleare in his eyes; but full of ſelfe loue, by-intentions and other imperfections.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:200342:40"/>
                  <p> Conclude to worke thy ſaluation vvith feare and trembling; neuer to preſume of thy good deeds, nor to ſlight and leſſen thy ill deeds: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring alwayes, that God is the iudge of both, in vvhoſe preſence the heauens are not pure.</p>
                  <p n="4">4, Conſider fourthly theſe fiue qualities of our iudge at that day: the firſt is, that hee is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie offended and iniured by our ſinnes, vvho is novv to take his owne reuenge of the guilty: ô vvho vvill not tremble to be iudged by him, whom hee hath offended? Secondly, hee is moſt wiſe and able to ſearch the very depth of our hearts, and to ballance aright euery thought, vvord and deed. Thirdly he is omnipotent, ſo that no man can ſtop his hand, no man reſiſt his vvill. Fourthly he is ſupreme ſoueraigne: no power created or increated aboue him, &amp; hence his ſentence is finall, &amp; vvithout appeale. Laſtly, hee vvill come then ſo full of vvrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the vvicked, that if all heauen &amp; earth should ioyne in petition for the leaſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that were, he would remaine inexorable and immoueable.</p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith thy ſelfe this neceſſarie and vvholeſome reſolution: that vvhereas on the one ſide, the Judge is moſt terrible, and moſt inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; on the other, the cauſe to be iudged of the greateſt importance and conſequence, that can be imagined: reſolue, I ſay, euer to liue in feare of the Iudge; euer to ſecure thy cauſe vvith the greateſt diligence thou canſt.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:200342:40"/>
                  <p> Conſider fifthly, how after that the whole plea is concluded, the Judge pronounceth the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and eternall ſentence of life or death: if of death, he caſteth the foule ſoule from him, with an vnſpeakable diſdaine and curſſe neuer to ſee the glorie of his face any more: then the good Angell deſerteth and forſaketh her alſo: goe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed wretch, that haſt deſpiſed my counſells; and reiected all the remedies, I haue vſed for thy ſaluation; goe with this thy black guardian, &amp; now eternally thy ſad companion: &amp; laſtly the ſayd deuills laying hold on her, impetuouſly throw her into the pit of hell, for euer and euer. But if the ſentence be of life, then the Iudge with an amiable, countenance, inuiteth her to the euerlaſting ioyes of his Kingdome; the deuill flyeth away conquered &amp; confoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Conclude with this prayer of S. Auguſtine: ô Lord my God, chaſtize me now, while this life dureth, vvith all the rigour, thou pleaſeſt; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me in all my ſenſes and members; burne me, quarter and cut me, vvhat vvay thou vvilt; in my health, in my honour and fame, in my goods and in whatſoeuer els; on condition that at the day of iudgement thou pronounce ſentence in my fauour,</p>

The ſecond, for that the loſſe and damnation of men created to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie &amp; redeemed with the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, is a thing ſo worthy of pitty and ſorrow, that the Deity it ſelfe were it ſubiect to ſuch paſſions, would grieue and lament their diſaſter, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore his will is, that all creatures lament and mourne for them.

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, how the world being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and reduced into the foure firſt elements; an Archangell shall ſound the trumpet, and raiſe his voice with a <hi>Surgite mortui, &amp; venite ad iudicium: riſe you dead and come to iudgment.</hi> A voice ſo shrill, that it shall be heard ouer the whole world, nay pierce the higheſt heauens and the deepeſt hell: and ſo powerfull alſo, that all the ſoules, that euer were created, shall ſuddenly, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, obey the call; and vniting themſelues euery one to her owne proper and indiuiduall body, shall all meet in the Uale of Ioſaphat. O the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power of our great God! which is able to raiſe ſuch a multitude of bodyes, ſo many
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:200342:44"/>wayes, ſo many ages agoe conſumed and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a thouſand changes; ſo that not the leaſt bone, nerue, or ſinew shall be wanting to any one. And what an admiration will it cauſe in the ſonnes of Adam, to ſee ſuch a multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de together, all of the ſame and equall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any difference of poore or rich, maſter or ſeruant, king or ſubiect; except onely that of the good and bad, which shall be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and eternall?</p>
                  <p>Conclude to obey now with prompt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence another like ſummon of S.

                  <p n="2">2.

O with what ioy and content will the happy ſoule enter into ſuch a body? what embraces, what congratulations will there paſſe betweene ſo ſweet a couple? bleſſed be thou my body, will the ſoule ſay, for helping me to gaine this glorie, by ſubmitting thy ſelfe to mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, faſtings, diſciplines, and other acts of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; moſt iuſt it is, that thou partake of my
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:200342:44"/>glorie and happines. Behold the bodyes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, rent, torne, burnt, deuoured by wild beaſts &amp;c. now more shining, then any orientall pearle, more florishing and glittering then any Rubie; more ſolid &amp; impaſſible, then any dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond. See alſo thoſe of Confeſſours, Virgins, Doctours, ſo beautifull, ſo glorious, that no tongue is able to expreſſe it. O happy penances, auſterities, afflictions, which haue deſerued ſo great glorie and immortalitie!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly the altogether contrarie condition of the damned: their bodyes immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, tis true, but onely that they may ſuffer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall torments: foule, black, filthy, heauy as lead, rotten and ſtinking, as when halfe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the graue: ſo that tis none of the leaſtpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for the ſoule to enter and be shut vp for euer in ſo loathſome and horrid a dungeon. What deſperation, what curſes and execrations will paſſe betwixt theſe two vnfortunate &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched companions? Accurſed body, quoth the ſoule, that to feed, pamper and pleaſure thee, haue caſt both my ſelfe and thee into theſe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments: nay rather thou accurſed ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, quoth the body, that hauing the rule and power ouer me in thy hand and knowing my naturall and prone inclination to ſenſuality, didſt not gouerne &amp; ſubiect me as thou oughteſt to the rule of reaſon and pietie. Theſe and ſuch like are to be their morning and euening ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for all Eternitie.</p>
                  <p>Conclude which of theſe two ſtates &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:200342:45"/>thou doſt like beſt; for now free leaue is giuen thee to chuſe either: I thinke no man will conſult much vpon the choice: wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to rule, mortifie, and ſubiect the paſſions and appetites of thy body in this life, that in the next they may be a comfort and bliſſe, one to the other: and whenſoeuer the body shall offer to rebell, checke it with repreſenting the two ſtates of the next world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly the terrour &amp; maieſty of our.

O what a ioyfull fight will this bee to the iuſt, and thoſe that are already ſecured of their ſaluation? but how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the wicked? the flames of hell are more ſufferable, then the inflamed countenance of the angry iudge: then would they, if they could, hide themſelues in rockes and caues, in the center of the earth, in hell it ſelfe, rather then abide this encounter: then will they cry to the mountaines and rockes; <hi>Cadite ſuper nos, &amp;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:200342:45"/>abſcondite nos à facie ſedentis ſuper thronum, &amp; ab ira Agni, quoniam venit dies magnus irae ipſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.

                  <p n="5">5.

O vvhat furie, vvhat confuſion and enuy vvill poſſeſſe and torture the ſoules of the vvicked, eſpecially thoſe of Princes, Potentates, and rich perſons in this vvorld, to ſee themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſo contemned, and the poore and ſimple ſo exalted? then vvill they groane and cry out: <hi>Hi ſunt, quos habuimus aliquando in deriſum &amp; in ſimilits. dinem improperij: nos inſenſati, vitam illorum aeſtimabamus inſaniam &amp; finem illorum ſine honore: ecce quomodo computati ſunt inter fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios Dei, &amp; inter Sanctos ſors illorum est? ergo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauimus a via veritatis &amp;c.

What glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and honour vvill it be to the iuſt, to haue all their good vvorkes come now to light, vvhich in this vvorld they laboured to hide, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale in humble ſilence: and although their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shall be expoſed to view, yet they shall be ſo adorned and accompanied vvith holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Conclude to haue a great care, what thou wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt here in this ſayd booke, for euen ſo shall it there appeare, if gold, gold; if inke, inke; &amp; be ſure of our Sauiours ſaying, <hi>Nihil abſconditum, quod non manifeſtabitur: there is nothing hid, vvhich shall not be made manifeſt.</hi> Jt is therefore more vviſedome to refraine altogether from what thou wouldeſt not haue knowne, then by doing it, to expoſe thy ſelfe to a certaine confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and shame.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that the interiour anguish and torment of a ſoule in hell, is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout compariſon greater, then all tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of the body; though but few can imagine it ſo.

The inferiour and ſenſitiue appetite
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200342:53"/>is miſerably rent aſunder with whole troopes of moſt violent, and withall contrary paſſions, as of feares and frights, ſadneſſe, hatred, fury; enuy, longings, &amp; heauy deſpaires of obtaining any thing.

                  <p>Conclude, for the auoyding of theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to imploy thy will here in the loue of thy God; to bridle thy appetites and ſubdue them to reaſon; and to accuſtome thy imagination to pious and holy obiects: for as wee doe here ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate them, ſo shall they doe or ſuffer in the next world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>Conclude therefore to loſe all, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all, rather then of God: pray that all the miſeries of this world and torments of the next, may come vpon thee, ſo thou may eſcape this one; <hi>Fac me, Domine, tuis ſemper inhaerere mandatis &amp; à te numquam ſeparari parmittas.

                  <p n="4">4.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:200342:54"/>firſt day or houre. But, which is moſt fearefull of all to thinke on, the durance of them shall be for euer and eternall without end; as long as God shall be God, shall theſe paines endure in their full vigour &amp; ſtrength; this shall the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned know &amp; neuer ceaſe to thinke on. O feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Eternitie, who can comprehend thee? who can looke beyond thee? count ten millions of yeares for euery ſtarre in the skye, for euery moat in the Sunne, for euery ſand in the ſea; &amp; shall theſe tormenrs then come to an end and expire? ô nothing leſſe: they shall then beginne afresh and runne ouer the ſayd millions a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of times for euer.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Conſider fifthly, or rather conclude out of what hath hitherto been conſidered; firſt a ſtrong reſolution to prepare for this day of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that neuer hath night: firſt by purging thy ſoule from all mortall ſinne by true penance &amp; confeſſion; for hell can ſwallow nothing, but what is infected with mortall ſinne: this done, and all ſecured for what is paſt; then carefully prouide for the future by mortification and the practiſe of a vertuous life; hauing alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy eyes, the eternity of paines on the one ſide; and this will ſtrengthen the againſt the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and difficulties of vertue; &amp; on the other fide, how few there are, that eſcape them; <hi>Multi vocati, pauci electi: many are called, fevv

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:200342:55"/>and enioy him, doe from hence ſuffer an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable anguish and paine, to be ſo detained from him: ſecondly, becauſe they know not certainely, how long this will endure; it may be for a hundred yeares, it may be till the day of iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to frame a different iudgement of the paines of Purgatorie, them worldlings doe? who thinke, if they eſcape hell, that the reſt is but a fleabite: endeauour alſo to auoyd veniall finnes, &amp; to labour to ſatisfie for all here, at a farre eafier rate, then it can be done there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, the rigour of Gods iuſtice, in chaſtiſing ſo terribly ſinnes ſo light, ſo veniall, as we eſteeme them; and this in the damned of hell, would be no ſuch wonder; for they are his enemies, and obſtinate in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt him; but theſe poore and holy ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les are his friends and faithfull ſeruants, reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all things to his bleſſed will; nay with a wonderfull reſignation actually thanking him, as much for this his iuſtice &amp; heauy hand vpon them, as for the glory and bliſſe he will shortly giue them: and yet ſuch is his hatred to all ſort of ſinne, that for no former ſeruices done him, for no reſpects of preſent or future amity, will he abate the leaſt <hi>puntillo</hi> of his iuſtice, <hi>Sed ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent vſque ad vltimum quadrantem.

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that the eſſential beatitude of the ſoule conſiſteth in a moſt perfect, pure, and amiable vnion with God; that is, in a cleare viſion of his eſſence, attributes, &amp; perfections, by which the ſoule is transformed into God, deified, or made God by participation; <hi>Scimus</hi> quoth S. Iohn, <hi>quoniam cum apparuerit ſimiles ei erimus, quoniam videbimus eum ſicuti eſt. We knovv that vvhen he shal appeare, vve shal be like to him, becauſe vve shal ſee him as he is.</hi> Haue you ſeene glaſſe or iron in the furnace, ſo penetrated and incorporated with the fire, that in heat, in ſplendour, in colour, and all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:200342:57"/>other qualities, it ſeemeth no more it ſelfe, but all flame and fire: ſo the ſoule by this ſpirituall and intellectuall vnion with god, is thoroughly penetrated with the ſplendours of the diuine eſſence, no more now herſelfe, but a ſecond Demi God. Hence it is that the ſoule reſteth ſo full, ſo ſatisfied and ſecurely contented, hauing within and without her the well-head, or Ocean of vniuerſall good and bliſſe, neuer more to want, neuer more to feare.</p>
                  <p>Conclude with wonder and admiration of Gods infinite bounty and liberality, to raiſe a poore and fraile creature, whoſe origen was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whoſe being a blaſt, to that heigth, and dignitie, that the omnipotency of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, cannot mount her to a higher ſtate or degree.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the happy functions of the three powers of the ſoule; the vnderſtanding, will, and memorie: the vnderſtanding ſeeth moſt clearely the diuine Eſſence, and nature with all its attributes and perfections, of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Eternity, Immenſity, Omnipotency &amp;c. Next is layed open to her view that moſt hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſterie of the B. Trinity; how one God ſubſiſteth in three Perſons; how the Sonne is from eternity begotten of his Father; and how the holy Ghoſt without generation proceedeth from both: then the myſterie of the Incarnation is diſcouered, how one perſon can ſubſiſt in two natures &amp;c. Finally all the ſecrets of our faith; all the wondrous workes of God, both of nature
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:200342:58"/>and grace; all his now hidden iudgements of prouidence, predeſtination &amp;c. shall be then with infinite delight knowne and penetrated. Hence the will of neceſſity is inflamed and ſet on fire with a moſt ardent and feruorous loue of God, as of her father, benefactour, friend, eſpouſe, &amp; what ſo euer other title she can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. Now the memorie is drowned in God: as in an Ocean of delights; neither can she thinke of any thing, but of God: looking backward, she ſeeth all the benefits, he hath done for her; and how she hath eſcaped, where others haue peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; and that by his grace onely: looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, shee ſeeth nothing but eternall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of felicity: ô happy ſoule!</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly the exceſſiue bounty of our good God, who giueth his ſeruants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their loyalty, as much as he is able to giue; that is, himſelfe fully and clearely, as he is in him ſelfe; that is, <hi>Bonum infinitum, vltra quod, nec est, nec dari poteſt aliquid.

God himſelfe, the B.

Finally note out of S. Thomas, how our deareſt God is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours: <hi>Se naſcens dedit ſocium, conueſcens in edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, ſe moriens in pretium, ſe regnans dat in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium. In his hirth making himſelfe our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in his last ſupper our food, in his death our Redeemer, in heauen our revvard.</hi> And shall not wee be altogether his, in life and death, <hi>In tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore &amp; aeternitate? In time and eternitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude with an humble oblation of thy ſelfe, to be euer his; and conceiue an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to ſee and enioy that ſoueraigne beauty of his diuine Eſſence; to which nothing doth more neerly diſpoſe, then purity of heart; <hi>Beati mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do corde, quoniam ipſi Deum videbunt.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly two conditions more of this felicity, which make it perfect &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; <hi>viz:</hi> that it is to endure for all Eternity, as long as God shall be God; and neuer to grow
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:200342:59"/>tedious or wearyſome, as the pleaſures of this world doe; but is alwayes new, alwayes fresh. O what a ſecure and ſetled ioy doth it cauſe, to thinke and know, that this happy ſtate shall neuer haue an end? after millions and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of yeares, I am as farre of from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of my ioyes, as at the firſt houre, I entred into them: thoſe that cannot conceiue, what this is, let them reflect, what a cooling blaſt it is to the greateſt Monarchs of the world, in the height of their glorie, to thinke that all this muſt be left, God knoweth how ſoone; but by death infallibly; and what would they giue for the ſecurity of a hundred yeares? <hi>ô beati qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant in domo tua Domine, in ſaecula ſaeculorum laudabunt te: ô hleſſed are they, that dvvel in thy houſe, ô lord, for euer and euer they shal praiſe thee.</hi> Againe, the diuine Eſſence is ſo infinite in beauty and delights; that the more, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the ſoule doth behold it, the greater content she receiueth, and the more doth shee deſire to behold it; ſo that there is, <hi>Sitis abſque paena: thirſt vvithout paine,</hi> becauſe the thirſt is euer ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and againe, <hi>Saturitas ſine fastidio; abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vvithout cloying;</hi> becauſe that doth a-new whet and refresh the appetite.</p>

                  <head>THE THIRD MEDITATION. <hi>Of the glory of the Body.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, the wonderfull liberality God vſeth towards his ſeruants: for not content to raiſe the ſoule to ſo great a degree of glorie, as shee is capable of, and hath deſerued; he doth alſo for her ſake and reſpect, glorifie her body too, which did rather hinder and decline the poore ſoule from heauen, by her groſſe inclinations and ſenſualityes, then any way aduance her thither. This was, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Abraham, to wit, that he vvould not onely bliſſe his ſonne Iſaac, his true and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate heire, but alſo he would haue an eſpeciall care of Iſmael, begotten on a ſlaue; becauſe he was a thing belonging to him. So becauſe the body belonged to his ſeruant, as well as the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, he doth alſo raiſe it out of the dirt, &amp; place it amongſt the Princes of glory: ô what power is this that can clenſe and purge ſo ſtinking a puddle, as our body is, and bring it to ſuch ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour &amp; brightnes, as thoſe great Courtiers and Grandees of heauen diſdaine not, to admit it to their company, and giue it a ſeat amidſt their Thrones. This is, what the Prouerbe ſayes: <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes domestici eius vestiti ſunt duplicibus; all his houshoulds are clothed vvith duble.</hi> All his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants haue double Robes of glory, one of the ſoule, another of the body.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:200342:60"/>
                  <p> Conclude to get here the full maſtery and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer thy body; and eſpecially endeauour to purge it, <hi>Ab omni gula &amp; luxuria; from all gluttonie and luxerie.</hi> for nothing is more odious in the ſight of Angells, then theſe two ſwinish vices; and conſequently nothing more defiling the ſoule, and making it vncapable of their company; and nothing more gratefull, then temperance and chaſtity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the foure <hi>dotes,</hi> or <hi>gifts</hi> beſtowed on the body, to wit, Clarity, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, Agility and Impaſſibility. Clarity conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in a beauty and ſplendour, farre ſurpaſſing that of the ſtarres or Sunne; more bright then pearle, more tranſparent then any chryſtall or diamond; ſo that the whole anatomy &amp; frame of the body, as veines, ioynts &amp; arteries, appeare and reflect moſt glorious to the eye. Subtility maketh the body ſeeme more like a ſpirit, then body, more ſubtill, then the ayre, or beame of the Sunne; ſo that it can penetrate any ſtone or mettall, neuer ſo groſſe and hard, without rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or diuiſion. Agility or ſwiftnes is ſo great, that no eagle, no arrow, no not the Sunne can come neere it; rather like the caſt of an eye, or glance of a thought, it flyeth at the becke of the ſoule, millions and millions of leagues in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without ſtop or wearynes: by this, though heauen be neuer ſo wide, the Bleſſed conuerſe one with an other, as in the ſame roome. Impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fibility is an immortality, free from death, and infirmityes, from paine and toyle hunger and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:200342:60"/>cold &amp;c. euer vigorous, healthy &amp; ſound: and all theſe for all eternitie. Pardon bleſſed Angells and flaming Cherubins, that ſuch carcaſſes may ſtand amongſt you without shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

That the paſſions of this time, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne to the glorie to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly that the delight of the fiue corporall ſenſes shall not be there wanting, as ſome may feare; but shall be in a farre higher degree: for what a ioyfull and glorious obiect shall the fight haue in the beauty of thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Palaces, whoſe twelue gates are ſo many precious ſtones, whoſe walls and pauement are of burnishd and pellucid gold? then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bodyes beautified with the foure radiant qualities, as before, and aboue all the humanity of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, what gracious ſplendours, what delightfull Rubyes from thoſe wounds will it diſplay on all ſides?

Laſtly thy ſpirituall and ſupernaturall being by grace, is a pure grace and gift indeed; totally
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:200342:63"/>depending on the liberality &amp; goodnes of God, vvithout the leaſt diſpoſition or ſeed thereof in nature: ſo that by this ſole grace vve are vvhat vve are, that is the ſonnes of God, and heires of heauen; as alſo vvhat vve are not, that is free from all the ſinnes, vve haue not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and from the punishment of thoſe vve haue committed.</p>

                  <head>THE FIRST MEDITATION. <hi>Of the conueniences of the Incarnation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that the myſtery of the holy Incarnation vvas moſt conuenient for the honour &amp; glory of God himſelfe; firſt becauſe moſt conforme and agreable to his nature; vvhich being <hi>Summa bonitas, moſt ſurpaſſing goodneſſe,</hi> is alſo, <hi>Sui ſummè communicatua, moſt free in communicating it ſelfe,</hi> and in this myſtery vniting mans nature to the diuiue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee hath in a manner communicated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to all creatures, <hi>Nam homo quoad aliquid eſt omnis creatura. For man in ſomethinge parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates of euerie creature.</hi> Secondly the ſinne of man vvas infinite, becauſe againſt infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and ſo the ſatisfaction vvas alſo to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; but hovv should this be done? God vvas
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:200342:65"/>infinite, but being the perſon offended, could not ſatisfie; man had offended, and ſo vvas to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, but being finite and limited, couldnot doe it ſufficiently, that is infinitely: here the diuine vviſedome making one of God and man, ſound out a vvay, that man might ſatisfie, and God giue to the ſatisfaction infinite vvorth. Thirdly, by this Myſtery all the diuine attributes &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections haue appeared more, then by all the creatures beſides: but moſt of all, his mercy &amp; iuſtice haue here met in one; for vvhat greater iuſtice, then that the ſonne of God should pay vvith his blood and life for the ſinnes of men? and vvhat greater mercy, then that men should enioy and offer to God this price as their ovvne, and ſatisfie him there vvith?</p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith admiration of his vviſedome, and loue of that goodnes, vvhich hath been ſo bountifull tovvards thee: and here at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning offer thy ſelfe vvholly and ſincerely to his vvill and ſeruice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, hovv much this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery hath conduced to the honour and profit of mankind; for vvhat greater honour, then that a man should be truely &amp; ſubſtantially God, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſerued of all creatures? that all other men should be truly brothers of God? that men and Angells making vp one church, and one quire, the Prince &amp; head of both should be, not an Angell, but a man? that the Creatour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Iudge of all things, should be a true and reall man? ponder this ſeriouſly, not as a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:200342:66"/>fancy or conceit, but as a reall and ſolid truth. Now the profits and vtilities, that haue hence acrued vnto mankind, what memorie can ſumme them vp? or what tongue can vtter them? in a word, man by this myſtery hath been redeemed from the ſlauery and ſubiection of the diuell, &amp; all miſeries temporall and eternall following thereof; and is adopted the ſonne of God, heire of heauen &amp;c. Secondly we haue, in God made man, a preſent remedy and cure for all our paſſions and diſtempers: for vvhat can better cure our pride, than his humility? our bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery and couetouſneſſe, than his pouerty? our fury, than his patience? our rebellion, than his obedience? finally, our coldnes, and hardnes of heart, than his ſo tender &amp; inflamed loue of vs &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Conclude with this ſentence of S. Leo: <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſce, ô Christiane, dignitatem tuam, &amp; diuinae conſors factus naturae, noli in veterem vilitatem degeneri conuerſatione redire. Acknovvledge, ô Chriſtian, thy dignitie, and being novv made a companion in chriſt of the diuine nature ſcorne through a degenerous conuerſation to debaſe thy dignitie, and through ſinne to returne to thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vileneſſe.</hi> Haue a horrour to defile thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ſinne, which God hath ſo honoured and vnited to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, that vvhen two parties haue been long and old enemies, to bring them into a true ſetled peace and amity, ſuch a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour muſt be found out, as is moſt powerfull
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:200342:66"/>with both ſides, and alſo moſt truſty and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to both; without ſuſpicion of inclining more to one than the other, God almighty and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had been at long variance and enmity, euer ſince the ſinne of Adam; and a Mediatour could no where be found; God was the offended, man the offender; the Angells had little acquaintance with men, and depended totally of God; and ſo might haue deliuered man wholy ouer to Gods vvrath and iuſtice: when behold beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation ſteppeth forth Chriſt Ieſus, true God, &amp; true man, and conſequently a Mediatour vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout exception; for who more powerfull, more faithfull and carefull of the honour of God, then the onely ſonne of God? and vvho more truſty in the cauſe of men, then hee who is man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and <hi>Filius hominis? the ſonne of man.</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely if any may be vvithout ſuſpition truſted in his owne proper cauſe, Chriſt muſt needs be ſo; for conſiſting himſelfe of both natures, the buſines on both ſides muſt needs be his owne proper cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith gratitude to the diuine vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodnes, for inuenting a vvay and meane ſo equall and honourable for both ſides, though ſo coſtly to our deareſt Mediatour: and and reſolue from hence forvvard not to rule and ſquare thy actions according to thy owne eaſe and commodity, but only as it shall appeare conducing to Gods glorie and honour, how contrary ſoeuer is proue to thy ſelfe.</p>

                  <head>THE SECOND MEDITATION. <hi>Of the Annuntiation made to the Virgin Mary.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, the miſerable and ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the vvorld at that time; all but the little corner of Iury, vvas totally poſſeſſed and ſwayed by the Diuell; all Europe, Aſia, Africa, and the moſt vaſt America knew nothing but Idolatry, and adoration of ſtocks, ſtones and diuells, ſlaughtering and ſacrificing vnto them one an other; nay men forſooth vvould be alſo adored for Gods? as for other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and enormities, they were ſo in fashon amongſt all, that euen amongſt the Romans, the more ciuill and politick people of all, there vvas hardly a vice, but authoriſed by ſome godhead or other. Now in Iury where onely the true God was adored, it is lamentble to read in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus, how it vvas oppreſſed by the Romans; rent aſunder by Herod and by ſectaries, by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, couetouſneſſe, pride, ambition; and vvhat not? Behold euen then, vvhen noe man ſought, or thought of their remedy and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather ſtudied how to offend God more and more; euen then I ſay, vvas our moſt good God commiſerating from heauen our miſeries, and prouiding in that higheſt Conſiſtory of the B. Trinity for a ſpeedy remedy; which vvas, that the Eternall Word should become man: bleſſed be euer his goodneſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:200342:67"/>
                  <p> Conclude vvith moſt humble thankes to his diuine Maieſty, firſt in generall for this his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to mankind; and then in particular for thy ſelfe; calling to mind, how oft vvhen thou haſt been plunging thy ſelfe into all ſort of ſinne, euen then hath his goodnes been protecting thee from further euill, and procuring meanes for thy ſaluation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, how forthwith the Angell Gabriel was diſpatched from the higheſt heauens to carry the decreed embaſſages: but to vvhom? to the Empreſſe, thinke you, of Rome, to ſome great Queene, Princeſſe, or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, noble in blood, and famous for riches and pompe? nothing leſſe: harken to the Goſpell: <hi>Miſſus est Gabriel Angelus à Deo, in ciuitatem Galileae, cui nomen Nazareth; ad Virginem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſatam viro, cui nomen Ioſeph, de domo Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, &amp; nomen Virginis, Maria. The Angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel vvas ſent of God into, a citie of Galilee, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Nazareth, to a virgin deſpouſed to a man vvhoſe name vvas Ioſeph, of the houſe of Dauid, and the virgins nam vvas Marie.</hi> To a low &amp; humble Maid, eſpouſed to a tradeſman, liuing in the poore village of Nazareth; preferred in the eyes of God before all, for her puritie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and vertue. To this Uirgin therefore being at midnight in her deuotions, appeareth this glorious Angell, and vvith low reuerence ſaluteth her vvith theſe three titles of honour: haile full of grace, our Lord is vvith thee, and bleſſed art thou amongſt vvomen: at vvhich
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:200342:68"/>the Uirgin being troubled kept her ſelfe in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and expectation, of vvhat vvould follow: her trouble vvas not the ſight of an Angell, for that vvas not vnuſuall to her; but the high titles shee heard giuen her; <hi>Cogitabat qualis eſſet iſta ſalutatio, she thought vvhat manner of ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this should be.</hi> Farre aboue her moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts,</p>
                  <p>Conclude to enrich thy ſelfe vvith vertues, vvhich onely can make thee noble in the ſight of God: but chiefly to imitate the B. Virgins hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, which will cauſe a trouble in vs, not a tickling, vvhen we are praiſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly: the wonderfull eſteeme and tender care, the B. Virgin had of her purity and chaſtity, vowed and offered to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: for hauing vnderſtood by the Angell, that shee was choſen to be the Mother of God, and that shee was to conceiue and bring forth the onely ſonne of God; at what doe we thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, did shee demurr? at the Angells promiſe, or at Gods omnipotency? nothing leſſe: but, vvith a <hi>Quomodo fiet istud quoniam virum non eognoſco? hovv shal this be done; becauſe I knovv not man.</hi> She onely deſired to know, how her virginity might be ſecured; how shee could ioyntly be a Mother and a Uirgin: shewing her ſelfe readier to forgoe the dignity of being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, then the leaſt way to blaſt, or taint her pureſt flower of chaſtity. A rare paterne for all thoſe, that liue vnder the banner of Virginity or chaſtity. Wherefore being ſecured &amp; ſatisfied
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:200342:68"/>by the Angell, that the holy Ghoſt vvould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadow and protect her from all heat of ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: shee preſently falling vpon her knees, and bowing downe her head, gaue her humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in theſe words: <hi>Ecce ancilla Domini, fiat mihi ſecundum verbum tuum. Behold the hand maid of our Lord, be it done to me according to thy vvord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith humble and harty thankes to the B. Virgin for this her happy conſent, on which depended the Redemption of man: begge of her alſo, that shee will obtaine for thee of God her ſonne, a pure and cleane heart, a zeale and care of chaſtity, like that of hers; and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that ſo ſmall and light occaſions can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw thy conſtancy, as vſually they doe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly the moſt heroike ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the B, Uirgin in this paſſage: her faith of this moſt high myſterie, and that shee should remaine iointly both a Mother and a Uirgin: her hope and confidence of Gods promiſes: her ardent loue of God, and charity towards man kind her perfect obedience and reſignation to the Diuine will in all things, with a <hi>Fiat mihi ſeeundum verbum tuum. Be it done to me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy vvord.</hi> But aboue all her moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable humility; that after the great titles and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects giuen her by an Arch-angell; after she ſaw herſelfe exalted to the greateſt dignity that Gods omnipotency could raiſe a creature vnto, to wit to be true and naturall mother of God, shee was yet ſo farre from being puffed vp with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:200342:69"/>pride and ſelfe conceite, that proſtrating her ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe below all creatures, shee aſſumed no other title then. <hi>Ancilla Domini, the hand maid of our lord.</hi> The hand maid and ſlaue of our Lord; which, as holy Fathers affirme, shee euer vſed in all her life, and no other.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to imitate to thy vttermoſt theſe her vertues, both Theologicall and Morall; and of all the morall, chiefely that of her humility, which she had in moſt eſteeme; as alſo her ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. Let thy heart and mouth euer vſe this ſaying: <hi>Seruus tuus ſum ego Domine, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius aucillae tuae: I am thy ſeruant, ô lord, and the ſonne of thy hand maid:</hi> let this be euer thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt all aſſaults of pride or vaine glorie. Learne therefore the conditions of being a true and loyall ſlaue: firſt he is to be totally his Lords, all his labours, all his gaines, all his endeauours are for his Lord, nothing for himſelfe: ſecondly he ſerueth not onely his Lords perſon, but all his children, ſeruants, and family, a ſlaue, a drudge to all, beaten and contemned of all: and yet if loyall, hee beareth all with patience &amp; cheerfullnes. Till thou comply with this, thou art not truely <hi>Seruns Domini tui; the ſeruant of thy lord.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that no ſooner had the Virgin Mary giuen her full conſent with, <hi>Fiat mihi fecundum verbum tuum; be it done to me according to thy vvord;</hi> when the holy Ghoſt framed of her moſt pure and virginall blood, a mans body, though in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity ſmall and little, as others vſe to be; yet in quality moſt perfect, that is, with all its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſenſes as compleat and exact, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he had: then created he in it a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſoule, and withall tooke this humanity conſiſting of a body and ſoule, and vnited it to the eternall Word hypoſtatically and perſonally: whence reſults this Catholike verity: God is truely man, and the Virgin Mary is truely Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God. And thus was celebrated in the wombe of the Virgin Mother, that wonderfull vnion and matrimonie betwixt the ſonne of God and humane nature, a knot ſo ſtrong and indiſſoluble, that death it ſelfe could neuer looſe or cut it a ſunder; <hi>Quod enim ſemel aſſumpſit nunquam depoſuit. For vvhat he once aſſumed, he neuer depoſed.</hi> What vnderſtanding can here conceiue, or tongue expreſſe the acts, affections, and raptures, which poſſeſſed and tranſported the ſoule of the B. Virgin in this paſſage? The Diuines hold for moſt probable, that with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:200342:70"/>priuiledge shee ſaw clearely the diuine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the myſteries wrought in her, as the Angells and Saints now doe in heauen; and ſo no doubt shee excelled them all in knowledge and loue.</p>
                  <p>Conclude with the affections of admiration, loue and thankes-giuing: ſalute the B. Uirgin with the <hi>parabien</hi> of her new dignity of Mother of God: &amp; offer thy ſelfe for her perpetuall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant hence forward: and be ſure the beſt ſeruice, thou canſt doe her, is to imitate her vertues, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe three of charity, purity and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the chiefe gemmes of her diadem.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Conſider ſecondly, how the humanity of our B. Sauiour at the very inſtant of his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; vnion with the Word, was in the higheſt degree endowed with all the gifts of nature, grace, and glorie: his ſoule in cleare viſion and fruition of the diuine eſſence, his body, though litle, yet euery way perfect, both in naturall and ſubernaturall gifts, except thoſe of immortality and impaſſibility, both moſt due vnto it, as well for the dignity of his perſon, as alſo for the glory of his ſoule, which should haue redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the body: but he would haue it both mor: tall and paſſible, that he might ſuffer and die for man.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:200342:72"/>yet shee would not diſcloſe any thing of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſecrets, but remitted all to Gods goodnes and prouidence.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the happines S. Joſeph had to be the firſt man, that ſaw the Sonne of God incarnated and borne in the shape of man; who tooke and lulled him in his armes; who led and carried him in his boſome many a time; and as oft kiſſed that diuine face, <hi>In quem deſiderant Angeli prospicere: on vvhom the Angels deſire to looke.</hi> vvho hath earned bread for the Sonne of God and for his B.

                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, the innumerable &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable graces, priuiledges, and prerogatiues of the B. Virgin Mary. Firſt her naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of body vvas moſt beautifull and rare, and the compoſition of her mind moſt ſetled &amp; perfect; ſo that shee ſtrucke modeſty and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence into any that be held her. Next for her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall gifts; shee vvas conceiued vvithout the ſpot of originall ſinne, vvhich all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Adam are ſubiect to: hence followed that shee vvas free from <hi>Fome peccati, all in ward motions, and inclinations to ſinne.</hi> And that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vvarre, vvhich vvee all feele &amp; groane vnder; ſo that her inferiour parts vvas euer at the becke of her vvill and reaſon. Then vvas her ſoule filled brim-full with grace, charity, and all the vertues and gifts of the holy Ghoſt: nay ſoe ſingularly confirmed vvas shee in grace and ſanctity that shee neuer committed the leaſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:200342:75"/>veniall ſinne in all her life: a rare vvonder, that a humane creature in a fraile and mortall body, should in ſo many incident occaſions neuer erre, neuer offend in the leaſt word, thought, deed or motion interiour or exteriour; but all ruled with reaſon, and leuelled to the will of God. Againe no ſoouer conceiued, but endowed vvith the perfect vſe of reaſon, actually to know &amp; loue God, &amp; theſe acts shee neuer intermitted in the vvhole courſe of her life, but vvhether vvaking or ſleeping, shee vvas in a perpetuall act of the knowledge &amp; loue of God: &amp; hence followed an augment &amp; increaſe beyond imagination, of grace, charity &amp; ſanctity in her ſoule; farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the ſanctity of all the Saints &amp; Angells together, as Diuines doe hold: ſee how vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie the Angell ſaluted her <hi>Plenam gratiae, full of grace,</hi> aboue all other creatures.</p>
                  <p>Conclude with àdmiration, thankes-giuing, and vvhat elſe thy deuotion to the B. Uirgin Mary doth afford.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly, that beſides all the titles &amp; prerogatiues of the B. Uirgin, theſe two are moſt ſingular and proper vnto her: the firſt, that all the gifts of grace and glorie, vvhich come from God, come to vs all <hi>Mediante Maria, by her incerceſſion: Totius boni plenitudinem,</hi> quoth S. Bernard, <hi>poſuit Deus in Maria, vt proinde ſi quid spei in nobis eſt, ſi quid gaatiae, ſi quid ſalutis, ab illa nouerimus redundare. God hath placed in Marie the abundance of all vvhat is good, that thereby if vve find in our ſelues the leaſt either of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:200342:75"/>hope grace, or ſpirituall health, vve might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge her as from vvhom they all proceede.</hi> So that as God the Father will haue all our prayers and petitions ſealed or ſigned vvith the name of his onely Sonne <hi>Per Dominum noſtrum Ieſum Chriſtum; through our Lord Ieſus Christ</hi> So God the Sonne will haue all our petitions to him preſented and diſparched by his Mother: hence S. Anſelme vvas not afraid to ſay, <hi>Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cior nonnunquam est ſalus inuocato nomine Maria quàm iuuocato nomine Ieſu; non quod illa poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior ſit (nam per illum ipſa potens eſt) ſed quia matrem vult filius ſic honorare. That vve ſome times find a readier graunt of our demaunds as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the name of Marie, then of Ieſus, not that she is more povverfull then him vvho is the ſource, of all her abilities but that the ſonne would by this prerogatiue honour his mother.</hi> The ſecond, that a great ſigne of ones predeſtination or reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is his deuotion or neglect of the Virgin Mary, S. Anſelme; <hi>Sicut omnis, ô beatiſſima, à te auerſus, &amp; à te deſpectus, neceſſe est vt intereat; ita omnis ad te conuerſus, &amp; à te respectus impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile est vt pereat: as it is neceſſarie, ô bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he vvho looſeth thy fauour, should vvith it looſe his eternall ſaluation, ſoe it is impoſſible that any in thy fauour should perish.</hi> And S. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauenture; <hi>Qui dignè coluerit illam, iuſtificabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; qui neglexerit illam, morietur in pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ſuis: the grace of God vvill ſanctifie that hart, vvhich vvorthilie ſerueth thee, and he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected thee shall die in his ſinnes as a punishment
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:200342:76"/>of ſoe dangerous a neglect.</hi> And then concludes thus; <hi>Non ſolum in te peccant, ô Domina, qui tibi iniuriam irrogant, ſed etiam qui te non rogant. It is a ſinne against thee, ô ladie, not onlie to abuſe thy dignitie in derogating, but likevviſe not to vſe it in demaunding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude, as thou hopeſt for the fauours of God, &amp; as thou tendereſt thine owne ſaluation, to ſettle in thy ſoule a conſtant and ſolid deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the B. Virgin Mary; not a verball and outward show onely of deuotion, as many vſe, but a true and ſolid one, vvhich conſiſteth in an vnfained imitation of her vertues; eſpecially of her burning charity to God and man, her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt chaſtity in mind and body, and her lovveſt humility: imitate theſe and then confide in her, as in a moſt louing Mother; for she hath two breaſts, the one of fauours &amp; graces for the iuſt, the other of pity and mercy for ſinners.</p>

                  <p>Conclude two things, if thou deſireſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation of Angells and heauenly tidings or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations: the firſt, to empty thy heart from the affections of honours, riches, and pleaſures; and to weane thy body from ouer much ſleepe,

                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:200342:82"/> 2. Conſider ſecondly, the admirable charity and moſt profound humility of our B.

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, how our B. Sauiour no ſooner baptiſed, but he enters into the pennance, he had promiſed to doe; &amp; ſo betakes himſelfe into a vaſt and barren deſart, vvhere amongſt will beaſts and birds of the ayre, he paſſed forty vvhole dayes vvithout euer ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or drinking, in perpetuall prayer &amp; morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: if thou aske vvhy, ſince neither his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall body could deſerue ſuch rigour, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany any vvay hinder his contemplation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection? the reaſon is now giueu in his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, both to ſatisfie in himſelfe for thy ſinnes, and by example to moue thee to doe alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat for thy ſelfe. O happy deſart vvhereſoeuer thou art, ſanctified by ſo diuine an Hermit. holy caue, the bed chamber of our heauenly Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, rude and cold in thy ſelfe, but mollified now and warmed by the ardent ſighes of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed breaſt Bleſſed ground, vvhich ſerued for his bed and couch, and thrice happy ſtone on vvhuch his ſacred head reclined vveary &amp; heauy; full oft vvaſt thou bedewed vvith the ſalt teares that ſo oft came trickling downe his cheekes. O ſoule of mine, more barren than that deſart, more hard than thoſe ſtones, if thou canſt not afford one pious teare to vvarme his naked and frozen feet; if thou canſt not breathout one
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:200342:106"/>ſigh for his ſake, vvho doth both vveep &amp; ſigh ſo much for thee.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to enter into the deſart of pennance vvith thy Sauiour; helpe him to ſatisfie for thee, that is, helpe thy ſelfe by like mortification to ioyne his vnto thee, and make them fruitfull: but firſt be baptiſed, that is, vvashed and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from thy ſinnes. <hi>Scimus enim quod peccatores Deus non exaudit; vve knovv that ſinners God doth not heare,</hi> that done, make no dilations, for preſent ſatisfaction is more pleaſing and ſecure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, how our B. Sauiour ſeeing himſelfe ſo much honoured by the voice of his Father, and appearing of the holy Ghoſt flies preſently into the deſart, both to auoyd the flatteries and acclamations of the people, as alſo vvith the increaſe of Gods fauours, not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect &amp; ſlack, but rather increaſe alſo the rigour and auſteritie of a vertuous life; and this not for himſelfe, <hi>Sed vt nobis relinquat exemplum, vt ſequamur vestigia eius. But that he might leaue vs an example that vve may folovv his ſteppes.</hi> Soe this moſt humble and meeke lambe of God conuerſing and liuing amongſt the vvild beaſts of the vvoods; and certainely vvith more quiet and content would he haue paſſed for all his life, then liuing amongſt men, to ſee and beare vvith their beſtiall vices and abominable ſinnes and blaſphemyes; had not his preſence, doctrine &amp; example been neceſſarie for our amendment &amp; ſaluation. Bleſſed be this his ſweetnes and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenes
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:200342:106"/>to ſuffer and conuerſe vvith ſinners: and Bleſſed be his charity and goodnes, in preferring alwayes our ſaluation before his owne content; in ſparing no labour, or toyle how difficult ſo euer, vvhence might reſult any good of ours. O my ſoule, if vve could <hi>vice verſa againe</hi> but doe and ſay as much for him, his honour and content.</p>
                  <p>Conclude two things, firſt to flie withall the ſtrength of thy hart, all praiſe and flattery of men; and be ſorry at leaſt, that thou canſt not feele in thy ſelfe this diſlike: <hi>Magnam,</hi> quoth Thomas of Kempis, <hi>habet cordis tranquillita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, qui laudes nec curat, nec vituperat. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes a great tranquilitie of mind, vvho neither cares for nor diſcommends but is indifferent to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane praiſes.</hi> The ſecond, to imitate thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours meeknes and gentlenes in words &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that thou maiſt liue vvith the fierceſt and wildeſt men that are.</p>
                  <p>Conſider thirdly, how our Sauiour to teach vs in himſelfe, the vvay to a vertuous and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall life, makes his firſt entrance by faſting &amp; prayer: for faſting keepeth downe the body, &amp; prayer raiſeth vp the mind. His faſt vvas moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, for in forty dayes and nights he taſted not a bitt of bread nor drop of vvater; yet his prayer vvas ſo ardent, and his mind ſo rayſed in continuall contemplation, as both holy fathers, and Diuines doe thinke, that in all the ſaid time, he felt not the hunger and vvant that his body ſuffered; <hi>Sed poſtea eſuriit, but aftervvards he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:200342:107"/>felt both hunger,</hi> feeblenes and weaknes of body. So doe theſe two vertues of faſting and prayer concurre to the aduancing one the other, for faſting lifteth vp prayer to her full pitch, and prayer maketh faſting eaſie and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as it hath been verified in many thouſand of Saints: bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude, as thou euer hopeſt to attaine to a vertuous and ſpirituall life, to ſeeke no other inuentions nor by-paths, but to follow this high and beaten vvay that Chriſt and his Saints haue trodden before thee, of faſting and prayer; let vs be ashamed, that the eldeſt of vs, is yet ſo farre from either; from faſting, as that vvee murmure at euery diſpleaſing bit; from prayer, as that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery toy can eaſily carry vs from it; if not meere floth it ſelfe.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Conſider fifthly, and note theſe three or foure points vpon this matter: the firſt is, that the deuill neuer te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mpted our Sauiour, vntill he entred into the deſart to liue a hard and auſtere life; and then he vrged him to turne ſtones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bread: ſo doth he with vs; as long as vve liue at our eaſe and pleaſure, he troubleth vs not, but letteth vs ſaile on vvith a pleaſant gale; but if vve once turne about, and looke towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, preſently he ſetteth vpon vs, and perſuadeth vs to turne ſtones into bread, that is our hard &amp; auſtere beginnings into our former eaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The ſecond; he tempted not our Sauiour, till he ſavv him with hunger and deſire of meat; ſo it is, vvere it not for our appetites and deſires, the deuill could hardly find a vvay open to enter vpon vs; <hi>Unuſquiſque tentatur à concupiſcentia ſua ahſtractus &amp; illectus: euery one is tempted of his ovvne concupiſcence, abstracted and allured:</hi> ſee therefore, how much it behoueth vs to beare all our affections free and aboue terrene obiects. The third, the deuill tempted our Sauiour to precipitate him ſelfe from the higheſt pinnacle, and to proſtrate himſelfe before him: ſo doth he treat with vs, that vve throw ourſelues head long from the higheſt top of grace, and Gods
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:200342:108"/>fauour to the bottome of hell &amp; deſpaire; adore him or other creatures in ſtead of our Creatour; for in euery mortall ſinne ſo it really paſſeth; and to obtaine his end, he letteth little by lying or promiſing impoſſibilities; for if he be catched in them, he vvill neuer bluch, ſo he can catch firſt poore ſoules in his ſnares.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to enter vpon a vertuous life ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vvith courage: to bridle thy appetites &amp; inordinate deſires: not to beleeue the Deuills flatterings, promiſes or fawnings, laſtly, to thanke thy deareſt Sauiour for shevving thee the vvay hovv to reſiſt and vanquish him; as alſo for breaking his force firſt vpon his ovvne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred perſon.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt how our B. Sauiour after thirty yeares humility, pouerty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; after a Baptiſme in the vvaters of Jordan; after fourty dayes faſt and prayer, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:200342:109"/>the triple temptation of the Deuill ouercome; thinking himſelfe, in our manner of ſpeech ſufficiently armed and prepared for all encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, comes forth at length into the field, to fight againſt the great Goliah of ſinne and ignorance, to plant his new and heauenly doctrine in the vvorld, and by his owne death to redeeme man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. A perfect example for all thoſe vvho aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to the preaching of Chriſts word &amp; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of ſoules, how to prepare themſelues at home and vvithin themſelues ere they venture out to ſo dangerous and hard a combat.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Conclude ſince now thou art an Apoſtolicall diſciple of Chriſt, to ground thy ſelfe here with true vertues, but aboue all in humility and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and vvhen thou shalt be ſent to thy poore country, thinke not of thy eaſe &amp; commodity: but know that thou art ſent to goe thorough thick and thin vvith danger of health, vvealth, life and all, and this for the leaſt ſoule that there liueth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, the terrible oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contradiction the world made againſt our Sauiour in this enterpriſe, in his good name, honour and life: in his owne towne at the very beginning they layed hands on him, and would haue throwne him ouer a great ſteep to breake his neek: his owne kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred once vvould haue tied him vp for a foole or madman: in Iury how oft vvould they haue ſtoned him to death; ſo that once he fell into this ſweet expoſtulation vvith them, <hi>Multa bona opera feci vobis, propter quod horum vnltis me lapidare? many good vvorkes haue I done to you, for vvhich of thoſe vvorkes vvil you stone me?</hi> In Samaria they vvould not

O my ſoule, how carefull and ſollicitous is thy Sauiour for thy ſaluation, but how drowſie and careleſſe art thou? Behold him in the ſaddeſt plight, that euer happened; going and coming betwixt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and diſcipless there petitioning for his owne griefe, &amp; here ſolliciting their good and ſaluation; but can get not hearing on either ſide: left and forſaken of all, in a ſolitary place, in a darkſome night, in the deepeſt anguish of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſoule.

He vvho ſuffers vvhat thou haſt hitherto ſeen, is true God and true man; as God, beſides the common attributes of the diuinity, he is the ſecond; perſon of the B.

                  <p n="1">1. THe firſt point, and firſt queſtion: vvhy did our B. Lord ſuffer himſelfe to be tied vvith cords, and haled vvith ropes like a thiefe? Anſwer: Adam in Paradiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theft, eating the fruit vvas none of his owne, but forbidden him: for vvhich the Deuill had all his poſterity tied vp like theeues, in the cords of ſinne and damnation: to breake theſe bands, he that is incomprehenſible, vvould be comprehended, and he that is liberty it ſelfe, tyed vp like a thiefe</p>
                  <p>Kiſſe theſe bands, my ſoule, &amp; pray that they may tie vp thy vnderſtanding and affection in the knowledge and loue of thy Sauiour.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond queſtion: vvhy did he ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be accuſed with ſo many falſe vvitneſſes?

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:200342:148"/>that vvee might then be ſecured from thoſe iuſt and true ones. Thanke thy Redeemer, my ſoule, and that thou maiſt be the better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured at that day, follow now his example, and beare falſe calumnies and accuſations vvith patience.</p>
                  <p>The third queſtion: vvhy did he neuer make anſwer to any of them, being ſo falſe, and ſo oft vrged againſt him? Anſwer: falſity is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that nothing can ſo eaſily conſute it, as ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; no vvay ſo facile to diſcouer a ly, as to leaue it to it ſelfe; let it alone, &amp; you shall ſoone ſee, how it vvill vanish into ſmoke, and truth thine like the ſunne; <hi>Nam magna eſt veritas &amp; praeualet.

                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond point, and firſt queſtion: vvhy vvould our deare Lord ſuffer his diuine face to be ſpit on, and mufled vvith a dirty clout?

                     <hi>Vt nos à tenebris &amp; ſordibus, in quas nati ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, peccato ſc: &amp; ignorantia, liberaret: that he might free vs from the darkneſſe, &amp; vncleaneneſſe to vvitt ſinne and ignorance, in vvhich vve are borne:</hi> ô my ſoule take heed of ſpitting in thy Sauiours face vvith the Iewes; take heed of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering his face of mercy from thee.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond queſtion: vvhy would he be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reiected for a foole? Anſwer: to quell &amp; quench in vs the heat and vaine curioſity of knowing more then belongs vnto vs, inherited alſo from Adam's vaine hopes; <hi>Eritis ſicut dij, ſcientes bonum &amp; malum: you shall be like Gods, knovving good and euill:</hi> for if the originall Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome of the Eternall Father, from vvhence floweth all knowledge in heauen and in earth, be once eſteemed foolery; how shall man euer ſwell or be proud of his knowledge? But vvoe to vs poore bubbles, ſwelling euer vvith a puffe of ſelfe conceit till vvee breake our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>The third queſtion: vvhy vvould he ſuffer Barabbas, a thiefe and murderer, to be preferred before him?

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:200342:170"/>our benefactour is no leſſe than the infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of our Soueraigne God, vvhom all creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res adore vvith ttembling, and thinke themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues happy if he vouchſafe but a glance of his eye vpon them: vvhat value then muſt his vnualua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit be of? The ſecond is, on vvhom ſo great a Lord beſtoweth ſo rich gifts; and thou shalt find him to be man, that is, by nature a poore and vile vvorme, by ſinne an enemie, &amp; by ingratitude a monſter, a viper, gnawing out the bowells of the diuine Goodnes; nay vſing the very benefits as inſtruments to offend the Benefactour. The third is the manner; that is, no merit or deſert on our ſide, but rather obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and peruerſe vndeſerts; but on God's ſide an infinite liberality, franknes, ſweetnes and loue, vvairing on all occaſions to doe vs good; vvishing vs euer capable of more and more: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally euer ſtriuing <hi>Vincere in bono ſuo malum nostrum.

Ponder here a little, my ſoule, the boundleſſe goodnes of our greateſt God and Father. The vvhole machine of all that is created dependeth more on the leaſt beck of his will, than doth the shade on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or the light on the ſunne: let him but ſtop one moment his concourſe, and in the ſame moment, if not ſooner, all vvhatſoeuer from the higheſt Angell to the loweſt atome of the ſunne, vvill fade and vanish, not into duſt, but into nothing: yet, notwitſtanding this, and the infinite offences vvhich daylie prouoke him, he could neuer find in that his ſweeteſt heart to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate the leaſt creature, he hath made; but ſuſtaineth all in their being; and moſt patiently expecteth ſinners, vvhen they vvill returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: ô ſee how he hath protected thee in thy

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:200342:178"/>leſſe ſinnes, than thine; and that God, of pure pitty, should end an Angell to free thee then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and giue thee an houres time for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; vvhat profound and harty thankes vvouldſt thou giue him? vhat vnheard of penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce vvouldſt thou giue him? vvhat then? did'ſt thou thinke it a leſſe mercy to be kept from falling into hell, ſo iuſtly thy due, than to be dravvne out from thence? thinke on it vvell, and thou wilt find it othervviſe. Secondly, all the former benefits come from God freely vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rub on our ſides, but this comes from a God offended to his actuall and bitter enemies: thirdly hee muſt begin the friendship, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits vs vnto it; for vvee poore vvretches looke neither after him nor our ſelues, but poſt on to hell. Ponder, my ſoule, theſe points; and ſee vvhat father could ſo oft forgiue his child, as thy ſweeteſt God hath forgiuen thee; ſought thee round about the vvorld, and finding thee at hell doore, hath brought thee backe to his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and grace.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that this benefit is not onely older than the reſt, but as ancient as Eternity, or God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; ſo that vvhen he begot his eldeſt Sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in the ſame inſtant he adopted thee for his brother, companion and fellow-heire of heauen among the Angells and the reſt of his Saints: <hi>O amor antiquus! ô bonitas aeternal ô aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient louel ô euerlaſting goodneſſe!</hi> how long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I vvas, haſt thou had me in thy memorie? loued me as a father? and prepared heauen and earth for my habitation? and placed thy deareſt Sonne Ieſus our head, Captain and Prince of this thy Celeſtiall monarchy? <hi>O veritas antiqua quam ſero to cognoui? &amp; quàm tardè te amaui, bonitas aeterna? ô auncient truth hovv late haue

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, that vvhere as no man is certaine of his Predeſtination, nor, for all he can doe, euer shall be in this vvorld; yet many foolishly and moſt vnprofitably vex themſelues about that point, vvhich belongs not to them; and in the meane vvhile are totally careleſſe &amp; neglectiue in their duty to God, their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and themſelues; for vvhich they haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and expreſſe commands; and vvithout the obſeruance of vvhich they may be ſure they shall neuer be ſaued; as on the contrary neuer damned, if they comply vvith them: a great temptation of our enemy; but manfully to be repelled by this conſideration: as it is certaine, that God <hi>ab aeterno from all eternitie</hi> hath ſet downe and decreed vnchangeably our laſt lot, ſo it is no leſſe certaine, firſt that thou shalt neuer want ſufficient grace for thy ſaluation; ſecondly that thou shalt neuer be damned, but by thy
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:200342:180"/>owne fault; and thirdly, that it is in thy owne hand to ſaue thy ſelfe, if thou vvilt: all theſes howſoeuer hard to be explicated, are in them ſelues as infallibly true and vnqueſtionable, as is the firſt of Gods decree, to vvit all a like certaine by faith. Humbling therefore our ſelues to things vve vnderſtand not: let vs leaue to God vvhat belongs to him, and on our parts follow S.

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, how as by Baptiſme wee receiue our ſpirituall being and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and by Confirmation our full growth and increaſe; ſo by the holy Euchariſt, our ſpirituell food and nourishment. The two
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:200342:199"/>firſt are but once receiued, becauſe our being or generation is but one; and augmentation ceaſeth after vvee arriue to our full pitch and growth: but <hi>Nutritio durat toto tempore vitae, nutrition dureth all our lifetime,</hi> &amp; by conſequence ſo muſt the vſe of this moſt holy Sacrament. Now as in our corporall nourishment, vve find firſt the food or aliment, next the body that receiueth it and is fed by it, and thirdly the <hi>Calor naturalis, or naturall heat,</hi> by vvhich the nourishment is perfected and compleated: ſo in this our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nutrition wee find, firſt our heauenly food, the pretious body and bloud of the Sonne of God: next our poore, feeble and hungry ſoule; thirdle that <hi>Calor calestis, heauenlie heat, that is,</hi> the pure and ardent loue of God; by vvhich this moſt ſweet and celeſtiall nourishment is brought to perfection: for our ſpirituall life &amp; and perfection conſiſting in the vnion with our God and Sauiour. and loue being our onely knot and tie vvith God, it followeth, that our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life and increaſe of perfection conſiſteth and vvholly dependeth of loue. Finally as <hi>Calor naturalis, naturall heat</hi> doth conuert the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the ſubſtance of our body, and is it ſelfe alſo conſerued and fomented with the ſame food; ſo this ſweet heat of loue doth not onely perfect our ſpirituall nutrition, but is it ſelfe thereby moſt of all fed and increaſed; <hi>Nihil enim magis inflammat amorem quàm praeſentia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti realis; For nothing more inflameth loue, then the reall preſenſe of Chriſt;</hi> and this new feruour

                  <p>Conclude two things; the firſt is, to cleanſe thy ſoule of all cold, hard, or tepid affections; they hinder all good digeſtion: the next is, to vvarme and mollifie before hand the veſſell of thy heart vvith the fire of loue: this done, feare not, thy food shall doe thee good, <hi>Viues, viues &amp; non morieris.

                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, how the conuerſion of the bread and vvine into the boly and bloud of Chriſt, is a moſt cleare ſigne and type. how a Chriſtian ſoule by the vſe of this Sacrament is conuerted into the very ſoule and diuinity of Chriſt. For firſt, as the bread and vvine is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially and totally conuerted into the body &amp; bloud, ſo as nothing of them remaineth vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: euen ſo a Chriſtian ſoule is totally conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into her Sauiour, her heart into his heart, her vvill into his vvill, nothing now remaining of her properr vvill, proper loue, proper ſenſe; but all changed into his vvill, loue and ſenſe: a happy
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:200342:200"/>and bleſſed transſubſtantiation. Secondly as the ſubſtance of the bread and vvine being changed, there remaineth yet the outward appearance of both as formerly; ſo, though the inward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and affections of our ſoule be changed into Chriſt, yet outwardly vvee appeare as other men, by our corporall conuerſation vvith them. Thirdly as the bread and vvine are dignified and exalted by their conuerſion the moſt that may be; for vvhat greater dignity in heauen or earth, then to be really changed into the moſt glorious and immortall body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, true God and man? So a deuout ſoule ſignified by the bread, receiues the greateſt dignity that can be imagined; the body is made moſt pure, chaſt and ſubiect to the ſoule; and the ſoule is as it vvere vvholly deified in Chriſt and ſo the vvhole man is raiſed to the higheſt degree and ſteppe of perfection in this vvorld.</p>

               <p>THe motiues vvee haue to loue God aboue all other things, are three the firſt, his owne vvorth, beauty and perfection; the obiect of loue: the ſecond, the infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits

               <div n="1" type="meditation">
                  <head>THE FIRST MEDITATION. <hi>Hovv farre man is obliged, to God, for himſelfe and all other creatures.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, how man excelleth all other creatures from the heauens dovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevvard, not onely in that he hath an higher degree of being or perfection than they haue; but alſo that he alone ſeeth, vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and knoweth, vvhat, and from vvhom, and to vvhat end, both he and they haue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they enioy; vvhich none of all the other creatures doe vnderſtand or know. Out of this follow foure degrees of mans excellency aboue other creatures, worthy of our conſideration: the firſt is, that man onely knovveth &amp; clearely perceiueth both the gifts and perfections he hath in himſelfe, &amp; alſo thoſe of all other creatures beſides: the ſecond, that he onely knoweth, that, vvhat he hath in himſelfe, he
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:200342:208"/>hath not from himſelfe; the like of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they haue nothing from themſelues, nor yet from Man; but that both haue receiued all from an higher Lord and Benefactour; and this none of them know. The third, that he alone can ſeeke out, find and know this ſo good and liberall a Lord, vvhich none of the reſt can doe. The fourth; that he alone, hauing found this Lord, can remaine euer with him, offer him due thankes and gratitude; and finally, by lone make him his friend and perpetuall companion, which none of the other creatures can euer reach vnto.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to open at length thy eyes to ſee &amp; ponder theſe great priuiledges thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt aboue other creatures: next, to be euer moſt humbly gratefull to thy Creatour for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, that to find out the iuſt meaſure of obligation, that follovveth in man out of the prerogatiue of knowledge vvhich he hath aboue other creatures, vvee may ponder theſe three heads or motiues; towit, the benefactour, the benefit, and the Receiuer: for according to the greatnes of the benefit, the franknes, of the giuer, and the neceſſity of the Receiuer, doth increaſe proportionably the greatnes of the obligation, vvhen and where it is knowne and vnderſtood. To begin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the greatneſſe of the benefit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wee find it tvvo fold; the firſt is, that of the creation of the whole vvorld and of all
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:200342:209"/>creatures in it; the next is, vvhat God hath beſtowed vpon man in himſelfe. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider all the degrees of perfection diſperſed throughout the vvhole vvorld from the lovveſt to the higheſt; and vve shall find man onely and alone bound to God for them all; and that for two reaſons; the one, becauſe God hauing made all for his owne honour and glory, and the creatures not being able to pay him that tribute as not knowing either vvhat they haue or from vvhom they haue it, as man doth; it followeth that man onely is bound to thanke him for all: againe, all vvhat the creatures haue, they haue it more for the ſeruice of man than for themſelues; <hi>Omnia onim propter hominem, becauſe all thinges are for men;</hi> if ſo, then man ſurely is more, nay onely, bound to God for vvhat the creatures haue onely for his vſe.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to make a right vſe of thy domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer the creatures, that is, order them ſo to thy ovvne commodity, as thou direct vvithall both them &amp; thy ſelfe to the honour of God the giuer.</p>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:200342:209"/>for thy being, others for thy profit, others for thy recreation and delight, others for thy inſtruction and example; finally, all ſo abſolutely for thee, that thou canſt haue no being vvithout them; nor they any being at all, vvere it not to conſerue &amp; cherish thy being. O man, make vſe here a little of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of knowledge thou haſt aboue them; and thou shalt perceiue one generall cry or voice of them all to man: <hi>Accipe, Reade; take, restore:</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, enjoy and make vſe at thy pleaſure of the ſeruice and homage, vvee offer thee; but then; <hi>Redde debitum, reſtore thou vvhat is due, and</hi> repay the tribute of gratitude; not to vs; for what vvee doe is of force and neceſſity, and ſo not vvorth thankes; but there aboue to him, vvho moſt freely and frankly hath beſtowed vs and our ſeruices vpon thee. The Maſter is onely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be thankfull, for vvhat another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on his ſeruants, becauſe vvhat is done to them is for his onely reſpects and ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Conclude neuer to ſet thy affection on the creatures, thy ſeruants; but let thy eye &amp; heart euer bend vpward to the firſt ſource and ſpring of all: and reſolue to imitate, not the muddy hog, but the thankfull hen, lifting vp her head to heauen for euery drop of vvater she drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly, how the reſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures preſent alſo to the ſoule of Man moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſeruices and commodities: vve may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to two heads, the one of learning or
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:200342:210"/>knowledge, the other of ioy and content. For the firſt, vvee find by experienco, that all our ſcience and knowledge in this vvorld, whether ſpeculatiue or practicall, is drawne from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and qualities of creatures: and aboue all, that knowledge and feeling vvee haue of our greateſt God &amp; his perfections, vvhence haue vvee it, but from the contemplation of Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, mounting by little and little from theſe low valleys, to the <hi>top</hi> and <hi>Non plus vltra</hi> of that incomprehenſible Majeſty? Hence followeth the ſecond ſpring of ioy and content, vvhich our ſoule cannot but conceiue, vvhen she conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, firſt, the great dignity and excellency, she is poſſeſſed of aboue all other creatures; next, the nobleneſſe of her laſt end and <hi>Summum bonum, chiefeſt good,</hi> as not conſiſting in the muddy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligts common to brute beaſts; but in the radiant ſplendours of the Diuinity: and laſtly the great eſteeme her Creatour hath of her, in ordaining all creatures to her ſole ſeruice and delight: ſo that the vaſtnes, beauty and light of the heauens, the earth and ſea vvith all that's in them, had neuer been but onely for man.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to calculate and caſt vp, if thou art able, the greatneſſe of thy obligation to thy moſt bountifull Creatour: and thou vvilt find it in the extenſion equall to heauen and earth; but in the weight and meaſure correſpondent to the loue and eſteeme thy Creatour hath of thee, vvhich is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Conſider fifthly, how if this greater world
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:200342:210"/>created for man, draw ſuch an obligation vpon him, vvhat shall wee thinke, his owne Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme will doe, ſo rare an abridgement of his vvonders, ſo compleat a modell of the Diuinity it ſelfe?

But of his ſoule, ſpirituall, immortall, diuine, vvhat can be ſayd or thought? vvho, like an abſolute Queen and Empreſſe, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the royall ſeat of her Vnderſtanding &amp; Will, commandeth not onely the outward vvorld, but alſo her domeſtick family both of the vegetatiue and ſenſitiue part, with that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty as none but God hath greater. O pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little the Eagle eye of her Vnderſtanding, the vncontrollable <hi>Velle</hi> and <hi>Nolle, volition and nolition,</hi> of her vvill: finelly, how all creature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Conclude vvith aſtonishment of all thy powers, to ſee vvhat thou haſt receiued; then reſolue neuer to ſtoope thy ſoule to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vnleſſe it be to raiſe and returne it in an

                  <p n="6">6 Conſider ſixthly the condition and nature of the Benefactour, vvho hath beſtovved all the vvorld on man, and man on himſelfe: and thou shalt find the firſt roote and origin of all to haue been noe other, than his pure loue, magnanimity, and naturall liberality; ô vvho can fathom all the dimenſions of this all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actiue, and all-producing Loue? if vve looke on it's ſubſtance, it is God himſelfe, euery vvay infinite and immenſe; if on it's duration, it reacheth <hi>Ab aeterno in aeternum: from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to all eternitie,</hi> if on it's extenſion and circumference, it graſpeth the vvhole, both greater and leſſer vvorld; finally all that can be called <hi>Ens creatum, a created thinge,</hi> are but effects, ſignes, and ſmall ſtreames of this Ocean. If wee reflect on the nature of this diuine flame, it is moſt pure, ſincere, and liberall; no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent motiue could raiſe it, being in it ſelfe before all things; no hope of proper intereſt could draw it's intention, being in it ſelfe <hi>Ens independens nec indigens aliquo.

Behold at lenght, ô Man, to what an height
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:200342:211"/>thy obligation is mounted as high as the Godhead it ſelfe; then tell me, <hi>Quomodo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribues Domino? hovv vvilt thou make retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thy Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith an humble and perfect gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to cloſe vp the circle vvhich God hath begun; that is, as he by loue hath made all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for thee, and thee the Lord &amp; <hi>Gran Seigner</hi> of them all, ſo reſolue thou to returne both them and thy ſelfe by loue and gratitude to the honour of thy Creatour.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider ſeauenthly the poore and low condition of the Receiuer, that is of Man. To doe a courteſie for one that ſtands in ſmall need of it, may be kindly accepted for the good will of the giuer onely, but otherwiſe not much eſteemed; which yet, vvere the receiuer in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, vvould deſerue another ſort of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and gratitude. So then it is, God the giuer is no vvay bound, but moſt frankly and freely giueth vvhat and vvhere he pleaſeth; but poore man ſtandeth in ſuch extreame neceſſity, firſt of hauing, and then of keeping vvhat he hath; that, as at firſt he is <hi>Prorſus nihil, meere nothing,</hi> without the bounty of his benefactour; ſo would hé without the ſame continuall influence and conſeruation ſoone returne and vanish into his former nothing.

                  <head>THE SECOND MEDITATION. <hi>VVhat Man is bound to returne to God for all his benefits; to vvit, Loue.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſidr firſt, how hauing euidently concluded the obligation and debt of man towards God for all his benefits receiued, it followeth now to ſeeke out, vvhat it is that Man is bound by the law of gratitude to returne vnto him, in recompence and requit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for all; for ſure it is, that, whereas an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation requireth a retribution, at leaſt of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Man being ſo much obliged &amp; knowing
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:200342:212"/>himſelfe to be ſo, muſt of neceſſity haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat vvhere with, in ſome proportion at leaſt, to ſatisfie his Creatour; for otherwiſe, both the obligation vvere void and of none effect; and man vvould liue in continuall anguish, as knowing himſelfe moſt obliged, and yet no vvay able to shew himſelfe gratefull. Againe, it is certaine, that vvhat he returneth muſt be a thing of his owne; and, as vvee ſay, his proper ſtock; that is, in his owne free power, diſpoſing and command; otherwiſe it would not be a free offer; nor acceptable to his Lord: vvhat thing then muſt this be? it cannot be this outward vvorld, nor any of the creatures in it; for theſe may by violence be taken &amp; vvreſted from him, and ſo not freely at his diſpoſall; the ſame may be ſaid of his body &amp; all his members, nay the ſame of his ſoule and all her inferiour ſenſes? onely therefore his <hi>Liberum arbitrium</hi> his <hi>free vvill</hi> can by no force be taken from him, that is, <hi>Ipſo inuito, against his vvill</hi> ſubiected to any command; vvhoſe firſt act and, as I may ſay, eldeſt daughter being Loue, this is the Jewell or Orientall pearle vvhich man may and muſt offer in gratitude to his God.</p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith thankes to God, for the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Iewell ſo acceptable vnto him; and begin from henceforth to make the daylie offering of Loue vnto him; but ſee that it be entire and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, Conſider ſecondly the worth and value of Loue in the ſight of God, and how vvell he
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:200342:213"/>reſteth content and ſatisfied therewith. Firſt, Loue <hi>Perſe &amp; ſine omni alto, alone vvithout any thing elſe,</hi> is euer pleaſing and acceptable; in ſo much, that noe man, how rich and full ſoeuer, refuſeth to accept and embrace any man's loue that shall be ſincerely offered him; nay, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is offered vvithout loue or the appearance thereof, is no vvay gratefull or acceptable to any man. Secondly, the gift of loue is onely free, franke and liberall, and all other gifts are ſtyled ſo, onely from the loue and good vvill, vvith vvhich they are preſented. Thirdly, all thoſe that loue, deſire nothing ſo much as to be loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; nay indeed they deſire nothing elſe; hence they grieue, pine away and die, if they obtaine not that. See then, ô my ſoule, the ſingular eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme and deſire God hath of thy loue: he is full in himſelfe of all bliſſe, <hi>Et bonorum tuorum non egens; and needing none thy goods;</hi> yet he is, as it vvere, a petitioner to thee for thy loue; <hi>Fili, praebe mihi cer tuum: Sonne, gine me thy hart:</hi> and, as one louesſick, deſiring nothing but to be loued againe of thee; his vvill and pleaſure is, that thou imitate him in nothing but in Loue, and vvhat followes from loue; his other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes he reſerueth to himſelfe, this one of Loue he will haue common and mutuall: vvith Loue alone he acknowledgeth himſelfe fully ſatisfied for all his benefits: finally to Loue alone he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this priuiledge, to doe vvhat thee pleaſeth, <hi>Ama, &amp; fac quod vis.

                  <p> Conclude vvith great ioy of heart, that thou haſt found out ſo precious a levvell as Loue; ſo properly thy owne, ſo acceptable to God, ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfoctory for all his benefits: reſolue to ſet all other things aſide, and imploy thy ſelfe wholly in this oblation of Loue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly the qualities and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that this Loue muſt haue, to be pleaſing and acceptable; vvhich may be gathered, firſt from the Loue that God beares to Man: next from the ſeruice which the creatures yeeld him. God therefore loueth man aboue all creatures; nay properly ſpeaking, he loueth none but Man; ſince, for man alone he made all: ſo muſt Man loue God aboue all, or rather God alone; for from God alone, and none other, he receiueth and holdeth, vvhat he hath. God hath ſubiected the obedience and ſeruice of Creatures to Man alone; ſo let Man dedicate his vvhole loue and ſeruice to God alone. Finally God's loue to Man is infinite and continuall; ſo muſt Man's loue to God be vvith proportion, <hi>Ex tota anima &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus viribus. VVith thy vvhole ſoule, and vvith all thy ſtrength.</hi> Now for the creatures; as they offer to Man the beſt they haue; the heauens the beſt of their influences, the earth the beſt of her fruits, the beaſts, the beſt and vtmoſt of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and endeauours: ſo ought Man offer to his God the beſt and vtmoſt of his ſeruice, that is a Loue, pure, actiue and conſtant. Creatures ſerue man by day and night, in hot and cold, faire and foule vveather, and that ſincerely
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:200342:214"/>vvithout deceir or ſelfe reſpect: ſo muſt Man loue &amp; ſerue his God, in vvhat condition ſoeuer he be, ſick or vvell, poore or rich, purely to pleaſe and content him.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to learne and practice this leſſon of Loue; learne from God a loue; ardent, liberall, and noble: learne from the creatures, a loue, humble ready and ſincere: learne finally from both a loue of one onely, towit of God, vvho euer craueth <hi>Amorem integrum, entire loue,</hi> vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout conſortship of any.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly, how man can haue no excuſe not pretext from complying vvith his obligation of Loue: for firſt the free vvill of man is equall and the ſame in all; that is, abſolutely her ſelfe aboue all command or power vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; shee can neither be forced, nor yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from affecting and louing, vvhat &amp; vvhom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>THE FIRST MEDITATION. <hi>Of the nature and conditions of Loue, both good and bad.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that, (as vvee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready concluded) there is nothing left vs in this vvorld, that vvee may truely and freely eſteeme or call our-owne, but Loue; for vvhatſoeuer elſe beſides Loue, that vvee ſeeme to haue, is not truely in our power, or at our diſpoſing; but may be taken from vs, and diſpoſed of againſt our wills. Hence it followeth firſt, that if our. Loue bee good, all that vvee haue of our owne is good, and conſequently vvee our ſelues are good: but if our Loue be bad, then all that vvee haue is bad, and vvee alſo with it. Secondly, our Loue is all our ſtock; then, if wee beſtow it on any, vvee giue him all that wee haue; and if vvee loſe it, vvee loſe all vvee haue, and are vndone; and then vvee loſe our Loue, vvhen vvee beſtovv it vnvvorthily, and on them to vvhom it is no vvay due. Thirdly, if all that vvee call good and vertuous is nothing elſe but good Loue, that is, Loue vvell beſtovved; then ſurely, that man is truely vertuous, vvhoſe Loue is good and vvell beſtovved; and if all our tuillbe loue ill beſtovved, then he is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ill and vitious, vvhoſe Loue is ſo. O the great force of Loue, vvhich alone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depending of the vvhole vvorld, can make vs
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:200342:218"/>good and bad, vertuous and vitious happy and miſerable!</p>
                  <p>Conclude to looke on Loue, as on the tree in Paradiſe, <hi>Scientiae boni &amp; mali; of the knowledg of good and euill;</hi> or rather <hi>Vitae &amp; mortis. of life and death:</hi> and looke in time about thee, on vvhat obiect thou doſt caſt thy loue; eſteeme no more thy ſelfe nor any other, but according to the quality of your loues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly, hovv the nature and property of Loue is, to conjoine, vnite, nay change and conuert the Louer into the thing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for Loue is a gift freely and frankly be ſtovved on vvhom vvee pleaſe, and as long as vvee pleaſe; ſo that our loue is novv totally his, to vvhom vvee haue giuen it; a thing novv vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his dominion and command: novv if Loue carry the vvill vvith it, and the vvill command the vvhole man as it doth; it follovveth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, that the vvill alſo and the vvhole man is ſolely and totally his, vvhom he loueth, at his command and diſpoſing; and this ſubiection is ſo much the greater and more durable, in that it is not by violence or force of any, but by a free and voluntary tranſaction or gift, and ſo not to be taken of by the command or force of any; but onely vvhen loue and the vvill it ſelfe pleaſeth: yet, as long as she is a ſeruant, she of neceſſity vveareth the liuery of her beloued: ſo that the loue or vvill, vvhich loueth earthly things, be cometh in her ſelfe earthly; if car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, beſtiall and ſuperfluous things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:200342:218"/>alſo carnall, beſtiall and ſuperfluous; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally if our loue be of men, it is humane; if of Chriſt, Chriſtian; and if of God, it is diuine.</p>
                  <p>Conclude hereafter to beſtovv thy loue on ſome noble and vvorthy obiect; for of all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and fooleries none is ſo great, as for one to caſt himſelfe voluntarily vnder the dominion of a baſe companion for his mate and fellovv.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, that Loue is due to noe creature vvhatſoeuer, but onely to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and this is euident, firſt, becauſe by Loue vvee are changed into the thing loued; he then that loueth things inferiour to himſelfe, as are all the things of this vvorld, debaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt vnworthily, contrary to the nature of all other creatures, vvho euermore adhere to the perfecter, and ſtriue to aduance themſelues: vvhereas therefore none but God can any vvay perfect or better our will, ſurely none but he is vvorthy of our loue. Secondly, our vvill, and vvith her the vvhole man, by loue becometh a ſeruant and ſubiect to the thing beloued; but it is contrary to all reaſon and iuſtice, that any ſubiect himſelfe either to his inferiour or equall, but onely to his better, and conſequently onely to God by loue. Thirdly, loue requireth loue, vvhich none can returne vs ſo truely, ſo to our aduantage, as the infinite ſweetnes of our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God; vvhat then doe vvee ſo hunt after barren and deceitfull loues and friendships, and omit the ſource and origen of all true loue, euer open and euer crying vnto vs; <hi>Fili.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:200342:219"/>praebe mihi cor tuum? Sonne, giue me thy hart:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude, but vvith a ſtrong and manly reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, neuer to ſtoope any more thy loue to any creature; but to mount it vp, and ſix it onely in the Creatour, be ſorry therefor, and from this preſent, retract all leagues of loue and friendship vvith creatures, and make a new and firme one vvith thy God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly, that as the thing chiefly and principally loued can be but one, ſo true loue in it ſelfe can be but one; yet ſo, as that from this one and head-loue doe flow &amp; depend all other deſires, affections &amp; loues of our ſoules, as ſo many boughes or branches from one ſtock; ſo that, if our firſt loue be good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, all the reſt of our affections are good alſo and vertuous; but bad and vicious, if the firſt loue be ſo. Moreouer, our firſt loue taketh after the nature of the thing firſt beloued, being, as vvee haue ſaid, conuerted and changed into it: hence it followeth firſt, that if our firſt loue be of God, she becometh moſt high, beauteous, rich and conſtant; God in himſelfe being ſo: but if it be of any creature; then she is low, poore, fraile, inconſtant, neuer content, neuer ſecure; for ſo are all creatures. It followeth ſecondly, that if God be her beſt beloued, then she beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth moſt generous, ample, and common; louing all creatures alike for his reſpect, becauſe they are his and loued by him: but if any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular creature be her darling, then she is poore and narrow-hearted, full of ſelfe-reſpects, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:200342:219"/>intereſts, and by-intentions; for ſuch are all creatures.</p>
                  <p>Conclude againe, to fix thy loue on God alone, that ſo it may be ſweet in it ſelfe for thy owne ſoule, and for others common and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: ô free thy ſelfe from the ſlauery of a baſe and abiect loue, vvhat ſoeuer it coſt thee; marke how-thou hateſt in others a narrow-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider fifthly, how there can be but two things chiefly and principally loued; towit, either God, or ſome creature; and of creatures it muſt be that vvhich is moſt vnited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined with vs, that is our ſelues, and our owne proper will; and this loue is called proper loue, a capitall and declared enemy againſt the Sacred and Eternall Deity. For firſt, a will forſaking God and placing her loue in her ſelfe, maketh her ſelfe the but, the firſt and laſt obiect of all her thoughts, vvords and deedes; and is in this a traitour to God, and ſacrilegiouſly ſnatcheth from his head the crowne of his Deity; for it is God's priuiledge onely, to loue himſelfe, and to ſubſiſt in the pleaſure of his owne vvill. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the vvill that loueth her ſelfe, loueth all other things for her ſelfe onely, ſubiecteth all things elſe to her owne pleaſure honour and glory: vvhich is an other ſacriledge and theft; for God made all things for his owne honour onely. O horrible monſter of proper loue, <hi>Qui exaltat ſe ſuper omne quod dicitur Deus, aut quod coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur! vvhich exalteth it ſelfe aboue all that which
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:200342:220"/>is called God, or vvhich is vvorshipped!</hi> but alas, she vvill neuer carry is ſo; for the true God vvill, as he pleaſeth, take his owne reuenge, and hurry her into eternall obliuion.</p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith trembling and feare, to ſee how eaſily vvordlings contemne &amp; tread downe God almighty's ſole prerogatiue; and that for a little intereſt, a beaſtly pleaſure: reſolue thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be any more ſo audacious; but fight on thy God's ſide againſt ſo-ſoule a monſter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider ſixthly, that as the loue of God is the ground and origen of all goodnes content &amp; happines; ſo the loue of our ſelues is the ground and cauſe of all vvickednes, diſcontent and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. For the loue of God maketh a ſoule holy, humble, benigne, &amp; quiet; but proper loue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her irreligious, proud, curſt and turbulent. The loue of God is like to him, bounteous, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and generous: but proper loue is miſerable narrow and baſe-hearted. The loue of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſoule free, exempt, and aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all her fellow-creatures; but proper loue maketh her a ſlaue, &amp; ſubiect to the loweſt and vileſt of creatures. The loue of God enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the ſoule vvith a thouſand conſtant and ſtable Iewells; but proper loue vvith nothing but fume and vanity. The loue of God enlightneth the ſoule to ſee and apprehend clearely, both vvhat her ſelfe is, and vvhat her God, and all other things are: but proper loue blindeth ſo all the ſenſes, that nothing appeareth as it truely is. O poore vvorldling, raiſe vp thy head out of thy
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:200342:220"/>owne boſome, and looke towards heauen, <hi>Vbi pulchritudo eſt &amp; ſatietas aeterna. VVhere is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autie and eternall ſatietie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude to caſt this viper, this refined poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of thy heart; and cordially to embrace the loue of thy God: hereby thou vvilt pleaſe God more, then if thou shouldeſt raiſe the dead to life; and thy ſoule vvill ſoone feele the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt this ſweet and ſowre loue.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider ſeuently hovv the loue of God is moſt honoured, and praiſed of all; but proper loue moſt odious and hatefull to all: the reaſon is manifeſt; for the loue of God is one and the ſame in all thoſe that loue God, and ſo by it all are vnited vvith God and amongſt themſelues, by the conformity of their loues and the vnity of the thing loued: ſo all muſt needs be peace, concord and content among them; all, mutuall loue and ioy, for the common proſperities of one another. But on the contrary, the obiect of proper loue is different in euery one, for that euery one loueth himſelfe chiefely, and other things no further then they conduce, to their owne commodity, content, or honour: the loues therefore, and conſequently ſuch louers, muſt be as different as their obiects beloued; that is euery one for himſelfe; &amp; ſo can hang no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe together then Samſons foxes, by the taile of ſome intereſt or pleaſures; vvhich once loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, all falls to confuſion, jarres, vvarres, and endles ſtrifes, euery one ſtanding a loofe from the reſt, and vpon the guard onely of his owne
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:200342:221"/>honour and profit: and ſo oppoſing, enuying, &amp; vvreſting from others by right or vvrong, what he can, ô vvhat can there be amongſt ſuch, but a hellish hatred and malice?</p>
                  <p>Conclude as thou hopeſt for a heauen both in this and the next life, to loue thy God. <hi>Ex tote corde, &amp; ex tota anima: From thy vvhole hart, and from thy vvhole ſoule,</hi> and as for proper loue let it be in thy ſelfe, as it is in others, the obiect of thy hate: and know, that if euer thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the breaking of peace, it is out of ſelfe-loue that enſlaueth thee.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Conſider eightly, that although ſelfe-loue be ſuch a monſter; yet one excellent leſſon may be drawne from it; vvhich is, the manner and order how vvee ought to loue God: for obſerue vvhat method a ſelfe louer vſeth in louing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; the ſame a true louer muſt keepe in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God. Firſt then, a ſelfe-louer loueth and followeth ſolely his owne vvill and pleaſure, &amp; no man's elſe; ſo muſt a true louer follow the vvill of God, and no other. Secondly, a ſelfe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet ſeeketh &amp; cherisheth no man's honour but his owne, preferreth it before all others, &amp; would haue all men honour and reſpect him onely: in the ſame manner muſt a true louer exalt &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure God's honour by himſelfe and others, and hate all honour that is not conſiſtent vvith God's honour; abate and deſtroy it. Thirdly, a ſelfe louer ſeeketh his owne praiſe and fame, that all ſpeake vvell and none ill of him; ſo a true louer muſt ſeeke Gods praiſe onely, inuite,

Finally, a ſelfe-louer expecteth that men loue not onely him, hut all that belongeth vnto him, his cat, his dog: ſo muſt a true louer loue not onely God, but all that is God's alſo, that is all his creatures in their ranke and place, as they appertaine to God.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to learne and practiſe this pious leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: looke euer vpon thy owne heart, and what thou findeſt there pleaſing to thee, transfer it all and paſſe it ouer to thy God: this may ſeeme but little for him, but J vvish all vvould giue him that.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that as euery tree or plant beareth and yeeldeth a different fruit, according to it's kind; ſo the two prime loues of God &amp; our ſelues planted in our hearts, like trees in a field, muſt needs bring forth their different fruits; and that as contrary and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite as they themſelues are. The laſt and finall fruit that accrueth to man out of all his labours and endeauours in this vvorld, can be no other than ioy or ſadnes: for all other effects paſſe away, and theſe onely remaine; 'tis ioy, content, and quietnes of heart, that man ſeeketh for, in all

Now ſadnes is an ill fruit, &amp; ſo cannot proceed but from an ill tree, that is, from ſelfe loue; and ioy, being a good fruit, muſt ſpring from the good tree of the loue of God. See my ſoule, vvhat followeth hence; the fruit is like the tree, that is, ioy like to the loue whence it proceedeth: true loue is like to the thing loued, that is, like to God; and hence true ioy muſt be like to God, that is immortall, moſt copious, moſt beauteous and moſt ſweet.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Ioy, flowing from Loue, is the life of man, <hi>Nulla enim vita, vbi nullum gaudium; For there is no life, vvhere there is no ioy;</hi> all that man ſeeketh for, is ioy and content, &amp; hauing found that vvhich is true, flowing from true loue, he reſteth and feedeth on that; <hi>Gaudium enim di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latat
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:200342:222"/>cor, nutrit &amp; delectat.

O vvorldlings, vvhat ſeeke you in outward ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honours, pleaſures? content? <hi>Non est, vbi quaeritis; intus est non foris. It is not vvhere you ſeeke it; it is vvithin not vvithout.</hi> Fourthly, as Loue extendeth it ſelfe from God to all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for him; ſo doth alſo ioy: and hence doth true ioy multiply and increaſe as faſt as men doe: ſo that all is ioy, <hi>Intus &amp; foris; vvithin and vvithour,</hi> all mirth; no enuy, hatred, jealouſy, or debates among true louers.</p>
                  <p>Conclude, as thou hopeſt for any true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines in this vvorld, to foſter and cherish in thy heart the true and ſweeteſt loue of God.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly, that joy, the fruit of true loue, muſt be in the next life in it's height and full perfection; the law of true loue is, that the louers conceale and hide nothing from each other: as therefore the true louing ſoule hath in this life diſcouered and opened her ſelfe totally to her beloued. <hi>Et effudit in conſpectu Dei ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam

The louing ſoule therefore ſeeing God clearely with his radiant perfections and attributes, shall there arriue to the height of her loue, for <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num quo magis cognitum, eò magis amatum; good the more it is knovvne, the more is it loued;</hi> and conſequently to the height of her ioy and finall content, for ioy followeth the proportion of loue. Finally, the cleare ſight of the Deity being vnchangeable, the loue is alſo immoueable, and by good conſequence, the ioy perpetuall and ſecure; <hi>Et hac eſt aterna felicitas, anima mea. And this, my ſoule, is eternall felicitie.</hi> See, ô my ſoule, and admire the ſoaring vving, and sharpe eye of this Eagle Loue; she neuer ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, till she enter and diſcouer the boſome of the Deity.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to poure out thy heart here to thy God in a true, feruent and conſtant loue: take heed no creature haue any share in it, as thou hopeſt to haue God totally in heauen: know, the law of loue is, <hi>Totum pro toto. All for all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly, bow, as next to the loue of God is the loue of our neighbour like our ſelues; ſo, next to the ioy the loue of God produceth in vs, is the ioy the loue of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:200342:223"/>cauſeth; and becauſe vvee loué our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelues, it followeth that our ioy of his bliſſe is equall to the ioy of our owne. See then and conceiue if thou canſt ô my ſoule, the multiplication and reciprocation of our ioy in heauen; vvhere euery one is to haue and eniy the ioyes of all the bleſſed, both Angells &amp; men, according to the meaſure and extent of loue, vvhich is to all and euery one. This is vvhat the Prophet promiſeth vs: <hi>Tunc videbis &amp; afflues, &amp; mirabitur &amp; dilatabitur: cor tuum. Then shalt thou ſee, and abound, and thy hart shall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and be enlarged.</hi> There is yet one tortent more of ioy and delight, <hi>Quo inebriabimur in domo Dei, vvith vvhich vve shall be inebriated in the houſe of God,</hi> vvhich is this. All the Bleſſed doe loue God infinitely more than themſelues or any other; and conſequently reioice in his bliſſe vvithout compariſon more than in their owne or of all the reſt; and becauſe all are vnited by loue and ioy to God, they all meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in one an other's ioyes intrinſecally in the very God head; vvhere after a vvonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they ſee, loue and enioy one the other: <hi>Nec datur plus vltra. And this is the vtmost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude to practice here the loue of thy neighbour; and to reioyce here at his good hap, both ſpirituall and temporall; that ſo thou maiſt here begin thy heauen: and let thy loue of him be purely for God, and in God; for ſo vvill all turne to thy owne bliſſe and joy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider fifthly, how our good God is a

For euer, and God shall be all in all.</hi> View now and admire, ô Chriſtian ſoule, the golden and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious chaine of Loue; by loue all things receiued their being and conſeruation; by loue they all vvheel about, &amp; at length returne to their firſt origen; by loue they all haue eternall ioy and bliſſe in him, euery thing according to it's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: <hi>Cui ſit aeternus honor &amp; gloria. Amen. To vvhom be euerlasting honour and glorie Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude to buy this Orientall pearle of Loue, vvhatſoeuer paines and charges it coſt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:200342:224"/>thee. O make thy ſelfe vvith men and all other creatures happy in this vvorld and in the next; ô let none be miſerable, if thou canſt helpe it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider ſixthly on the other ſide, the fruits that proceed from ſelfe-loue, vvhich ſure muſt be oppoſite to the fruits of true loue. And yet vvee muſt grant that ſelfe-loue yeeldeth alſo a certaine kind of joy or content; for vvhoſoeuer obtaineth the honour, the pleaſure, or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity he loueth, muſt needs take ſome content and ioy; and this it is that maketh men ſo merry, laughing, and iouiall: but alas, if vvee looke into the inſide of it, vvee shall find it a painted joy, and a true ſadnes. For firſt, this kind of ioy is neuer obtained but vvith infinite toile, diſguſt, nay dammage of others, and the ruine of our owne ſoules; whereas true ioy coſteth no paines, is ſweet to others, and profitable to our ſelues. Secondly, this ioy, being gotten, is moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and iniurious to God; fot to rejoice in a ſinne committed is vvorſe than a ſimple loue of it; nay it is an abſolute and finall contempt of God: &amp; can this be to any ſoule a true comfort? Thirdly, this ioy is moſt short, fraile and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; nay ſure not to hold long, but to end in eternall miſery and ſadnes: ſo that, contrary to true ioy, it is hatefull to God and man; &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vvith it, or leaueth behind it, a true, bitter and euerlaſting griefe and ſadnes. O vvorldlings, reflect a little on your broken ſleeps, and daily thoughts; and ſure you vvill confeſſe your ioyes to be meere butterflies.</p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:200342:225"/>
                  <p> Conclude to vndeceiue thy ſelfe and friends at much as thou canſt; open thy eyes, and be not taken with ſo foolish &amp; bitter a bait: but reſolue to lay the axe at the root and cut of ſelfe-loue.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider ſeuently, that if true loue haue for it's fruit after this life, eternall ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſurely ſelfe-loue muſt, on the contrary, haue eternall ſadnes and anguish. And this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish shall be twofold; the firſt, ſuch a ſoule shall be totally and eternally depriued and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of whatſoeuer she deſireth and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for; what delights, honours, commodities she enjoyed here, are now left all behind; &amp; yet she longeth more than euer for them; but in vaine: againe, the true good and happines, for which she was created, she then will ſee moſt clearely and deſire moſt vehemently; &amp; withall shee ſeeth her ſelfe eternally depriued of it, and that by her owne fault onely. O moſt wretched creature, that shal neuer more enioy any glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of either true or falſe good! Secondly, she shall be forced to haue all that is moſt odious, aduerſe and grieuous to her: and firſt, for her eternall habitation, a darkeſome and ſtinking dungeon muſt be her houſe; her companions and play-fellowes, no better than deuills; the element she muſt liue in, fire and brimſtone; her food, the worme of her guilty conſcience &amp;c. and all this for euer, whether shee will or no. O moſt ſad and ſullen condition, <hi>Vbi nihil adest quod vult anima, &amp; nihil deest quod non vult! vvhere nothing is preſent, that the ſoule would
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:200342:225"/>haue, nothing vvanting vvhich it vvould not haue!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude with new hatred to the viper of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per loue, that at length deuoureth euen that poore and painted ioy, vvhich vvas at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered &amp; promſſed: ô turne in time thy thoughts and affections to that good vvhich will neuer faile thee.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt how God, being the great Artificer or work man of both the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and leſſer vvorld, hath made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vaine, but all for ſome particular end and ſeruice: that is, all other creatures for the ſeruice of Man, and man immediatly for his owne ſeruice; for nothing mediateth betwixt God and Man, he being God's image &amp; likenes hence it follovveth, that, as vvhatſoeuer infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour creatures haue is all for Man's vſe, ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Man hath aboue them, muſt be dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Gods's ſeruice; and what is that but all the good acts of his vvill and vnderſtanding? ſo that vvhatſoouer he is able to doe by any of theſe, he is bound to offer it continually all to his Maker: vvhy therefore hath he vnderdanding, vnleſſe if be to contemplate his Creatour? vvhy a free vvill, but to loue his maker? hath he the power to praiſe or extoll? ſurely he can ſo iuſtly praiſe none, as his owne Lord and Father. Can he giue honour or glory to any? and can he then omit to honour and glorify his God, the <hi>Primum prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium, the prime ſource,</hi> of all his good? can he reioice in the good of any, &amp; not in the good of his <hi>Sumiuum bonum? his chiefest good?</hi> Finally, vvhom can a creature feare but his Creatour;
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:200342:227"/>or vvhom can a childe reuerence and reſpect, but his Father?</p>
                  <p>Conclude to imploy all theſe faculties &amp; acts otherwiſe than perhaps thou haſt hitherto done or thought on: labour to reduce, as farre as in thee lyeth, the order and happines of our earthly Paradiſe; that is, reduce thy ſuperiour part to a perfect obedience, and feare of God; and thy inferiour part vvith other creatures vvill ſoone doe the like to thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly that although all other affections follow that of loue, ſo that giuing our loue to God, vvee cannot but giue him all the reſt; yet there is an eſpeciall reaſon and motiue for euery one apart. For firſt, the obiect of loue is goodnes in it ſelfe, and communicated to others; both vvhich being proper to God alone; he alone is to be loued of all; and moſt of Man, vvho knowes this. Secondly, the obiect of feare is povver and dominion; God then being an omnipotent Lord, and the onely Lord of man, it followeth that Man need feare none ſaue God; but feare him continually. Againe honour is due to excellency, and praiſe to vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prudence; God then being the ſource of all vvorth and dignity, &amp; his vviſedome being the producer, and prouidence the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of all things but eſpecially of Man; ſure man is bound by theſe titles to honour &amp; praiſe God aboue all things. The like is to be ſaid of faith, grounded on verity, vvhich in God is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, <hi>Neque fallitur aut fallit, Neither is hee
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:200342:228"/>deceiued, nor doth hee deceiue,</hi> and ſo an vnfallible credit is to be giuen him by man. Neither ought his hope to be leſſe than vndoubted &amp; certaine, hauing for it's ground a power, a knovvledge, a goodnes euery vvay infinite. Finally, all the good affections vvee can imagine ought to be referred ſolely and euer to God.</p>
                  <p>Conclude, as in thy loue ſo in all the reſt of thy affections, to regard and reſpect none but God: ſo shalt thou find a happines in this vvorld: ſee vvhat a dignity it is to acknovvledge none ouer thee but God; and vvhat's greater then to be vnder him.</p>

Conſider thirdly, that as loue is the firſt of all affections ſo vvithout loue none of the reſt, are either acceptable to God, or delightfull to the heart that offereth them; ſo that vvho fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vvithout loue, doth it vvith paine &amp; ſadnes, and vvho honoureth vvithout loue, is but a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer; and neither ſuch feare nor ſuch honour is gratefull to God: and the reaſon is, becauſe as nothing cometh of freely and frankly but loue, ſo nothing can be acceptable but loue, or for loue. Let vs ſee then hovv Loue and Feare differ, and yet vvith all agree and helpe one the other. Loue is franke and free, vvithout force and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, and conſequently euer vvith Pleaſure and delight; an abſolute and all commanding Lord: but feare of it ſelfe is the firſt, that is the lovveſt of ſlaues, alvvayes forced, euer in paine and anguish: againe, Loue by it's freedome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins vvith God, and ſpreadeth her vvings ouer
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:200342:228"/>all creatures for him; but the feare of God ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in avve of him onely, and of no other. Yet they meet together and concurre in this, that loue ſweetneth feare and maketh it free, that is, filiall; and feare tyeth and fixeth loue faſt to God: ſo theſe are the two chaines that linke and faſten a ſoule to God both ſtrongly and ſweetly?</p>
                  <p>Conclude to embrace and practice this ſoe ſweet and filiall feare, and shake of that other ſeruile one, fit for ſlaues not children of God: ſay euer vvith the Prophet; <hi>Exultate Domino eum tremore; reioyce to our Lord vvith trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi> exult vvith loue, and tremble jointly vvith feare.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly, that as from the loue of God there followeth a holy feare of him, ſo alſo from ſelfe-loue there ariſeth a feare as bad as it; yet vvith this difference; that the feare of God is alone, that is, he that feareth God feareth him onely, and nothing elſe either in heauen or hell; but hauing his eye euer vpon his Lord &amp; God, how to pleaſe and content him, as for all things elſe, he treads them vnder his feet, and is moro fearefull to them then afraid of them; and this is eaſily to be perceiued in the very countenance of thoſe that ſerue God. But ala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a ſelfe-louer, what is it that he feareth not? firſt his owne perdition and damnation; next death, that dreadfull mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the nigheſt ſtep to hell; then plagues, warres, ſickneſſes, the harbingers of death: next, all ſorts of diſtempers in the weather, as hears
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:200342:229"/>or colds, ſtormes at ſea or land; euery infirmity of his body, loſſe of his goods, noiſe of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: finally, euery shadow of danger, ô vvhat frights it putteth this poore wrech into? <hi>Et eſt vita eius pendens ante oculos eius: And his life is hanging before is eyes:</hi> ſo that in ſtead of one feare of God, vvhich he rejecteth, he is euer aſſaulted vvith a thouſand moſt gaſtly and vgly feares, &amp; is become the gally-ſlaue of euery the leaſt and vileſt creature.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to deliuer thy ſelfe from the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of vvordly feare, vvhich bringeth ſo many and daily frights vvith it; and embrace the feare of God onely, vvhich loue ſweetneth, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth free and delightfull: <hi>Timeat anima mea Dominum; &amp; confige timore tuo carnes meas.

The honour of povver is to doe things moſt povverfully; and hence Man acknovvledgeth God to be omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Qui operatur omnia fortiter: vvho vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all thinges mightely:</hi> the glory of vviſedome is to order things moſt vviſely, <hi>Et quia Deus diſponit omnia ſuauiter, And becauſe God diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of all thinges ſvveetely.</hi> Man ſtyleth him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely vviſe: the renovvne of goodnes is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe gifes and benefits moſt frankely, freely &amp; aboundantly; and, becauſe God doth this beyond all meaſure, <hi>Pluens ſuper iuſtos &amp; iniuſtos, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon iuſt, and vniuſt,</hi> Man cannot but exalt him vvith the titles of moſt good, moſt liberall, moſt magnificent. This all creatures doe in their dumbe language, but Man alone muſt ſupply for all knovvingly and louingly.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to eſteeme the great fauours God doth thee, firſt in making the vvhole vvorld for thy commodity; next in appointing thee to be the ſpokes man for all other creatures, and the ſole oratour, and dinulger of his name &amp; praiſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the ſtrict obligation that Man hath to honour and praiſe God, more than all other creatures haue. God, as is aboue ſaid, hath made all for his ovvne honour &amp; glory, this is the end and aime of all his vvorkes; honour therefore and glory is due vnto him from his creatures; vvhich duty noe creature knovving

                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly the dammages &amp; hurts, that an ambitious man incurreth by ſeeking his owne honour, and preferring it before Gods.

                  <p n="5">5.

                  <head>THE FIRST MEDITATION. <hi>Of the excellency of learning and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Scholler.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, how learning being the ornament of the mind, muſt as farre exceed all other qualities or faculties of the body, of beaſts or of other creatures; as the minde or ſoule of man ſurpaſſeth them all; which is vvithout proportion. Hence it is that ſchollers haue the preeminency aboue all other ſort of men; for there is no man, but laughes at a foole, how rich ſo euer; and in his heart reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a ſcholler, though neuer ſo poore, admires his diſcourſes, and vvillingly ſubmits his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a ſchollers opinion; looking on him as on a creature of a higher <hi>ranke</hi> or <hi>Species:</hi> this made Seneca ſay: <hi>Philoſophiae etiam apud peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimos honor est nunquam tantùm conualeſcit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitia; vt non philoſophiae nomen venerabile &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum maneat: Philoſophie is honoured euen by the vvorſt: neuer-doth vvickedneſſe ſoe much preuaile, that the name of Philoſophie should not be ſacred and venerable:</hi> and the Poet; that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens vno minor eſt loue, diues, liber, honoratus. The vviſeman is inferiour to none but Iupiter, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is rich, free, and honoured by all.</hi> Princes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, and Magiſtrates are thought to know more then other men; and if they be ſo, they are truely eſteemed; othervviſe not: hence Plato
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:200342:233"/>thought learning as neceſſary for a Prince, as is the ſoule for the body. Neither regularly can a ſcholler be poore, in caſe he ſeeke after riches &amp; contemne them not; for ſurely he hath a great aduantage ouer others in the Theoricke; ſo that a little induſtry ſufficeth to make the practicall compleat.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to thanke God Almighty vvith all thy heart for placing thee in the ranke of ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and reſolue to be conſtant in it; let not idle and flitting fancies of, J. know not vvhat, caſt thee downe belovv thy ſelfe; a fevv yeares vvill ſerue to place thee <hi>In apice humanitatis. In the full height of learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the true happines and content a ſchollers life hath aboue all others: looke about the vvorld a little and obſerue the reſtleſſe toyles, clamours &amp; miſeries of all other occupations, trades &amp; callings from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the King to the cobler: euery one complaineth of his ſtate and calling, and vvisheth he had vndertaken ſome other: onely the ſcholler knovveth no other, vvith vvhich to change, if he haue but taſted a little of the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſvveetnes of his ovvne; being moſt free from that common plague, called proper inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the ſource of all contentions and miſeries. The pleaſure of learning is moſt pure and Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall; moſt conſtant, gathering ſtrength vvith her increaſe: finally moſt ſecure and honorable, vvithout any danger of foule diſeaſes, blemish of fame, or breach of friendship: vvhereas all
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:200342:233"/>other pleaſures are groſſe, tumultuous &amp; fordid, moſt short and fraile, ſoone cloyng the appetite, <hi>Et nauſeam prouocantes: and prouoking loath ſomeneſſe:</hi> and laſtly all of them moſt hurtfull to the body, dangerous to our credit; and all moſt incompoſſible vvith true friendship, the onely jevvell of this mortall life: and yet hardly ſound in her ovvne purity and luſtre but amongſt ſchollers:</p>
                  <p>Conclude to enjoy the fullnes of happines, that God hath caſt into thy hands; and pity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then enuy thoſe, vvho like blind moles lye rooting vp the pleaſures of corpulent dregs: ply hard the cultiuating of thy mind; that thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light may euer goe increaſing thinke not of change, till others aſſure thee, of a condition better then thy ovvne; that is, change neuer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly the admirable excellency and prerogatiue of ſacred Diuinity. All other arts and ſciences are either ſpeculatiue or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; but Diuinity is both together; her ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue part rayſeth, or rather ingulfeth and drovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the vnderſtanding in the hidden myſteries of the Eternall Deity; and lodged as it vvere <hi>In ſinu Patris, in God the Fathers boſome,</hi> pleaſeth her ſelfe in the ſearch of thoſe vnconceiuable Proceſſions; vvhere to loſe her ſelfe, is her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt delight and her beſt knovvledge. Hence shee taketh her ſlight vvith more eaſe thorough the vvhole created machine, vvith the beginning, cauſes, gouernement, effects and finall period of the vvhole Vniuerſe. <hi>O, quid magis animum

Next the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magiſtrate and Lawyer conſult vvith the Diuine vpon the meaning, vnderſtanding &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the firſt and head principles of the lawes, vvhich they profeſſe.

This makes ſacred Diuinity an abſolute Lady and Princeſſe of the life of man; and the Profeſſours thereof hovv poore ſoeuer, yet truely eſteemed, honoured &amp; reuerenced.</p>

                  <head>THE SECOND MEDITATION. <hi>Motiues for the renevving of our good purpoſes and reſolutions.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt the fairenes and beauty of thy ſoule; vvhoſe vnderſtanding roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the vvhole vvorld vvith an Eagle's eye, and thence mounteth higher vnto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible being of Angells, and neuer ceaſeth till shee reach vnto the vnſpeakable and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:200342:248"/>nature of the Godheed; loſing her ſelfe at length in that deepeſt, but alſo ſweeteſt Ocean of Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides this, shee hath a free-will, ſo abſolute a Lady and Princeſſe, that no povver in heauen or earth can make her ſtoope or incline where of her ſelfe she liſteth not; and yet ſo ſoaring, that the Diuinity it ſelfe eſcapeth not her embraces; for by loue she reacheth vnto God, and tyeth vp vvith him the true knot of euerlaſting friendship. But aboue all ponder the capacity and vaſtnes of an humane heart, vvhoſe deſires nothing vnder God can fill vp and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; vvhoſe flight can find noe footing but in the Arke of Eternity: for tell me thou riotous ſoule of our Salomon, haſt thou euer found a full and permanent content in the height of all thy earthly delights? alâs! heare her vveary and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red voice, <hi>Vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas &amp; afflictio ſpiritus. Vanitie of vanities, and all is vanitie, and affliction of spiritt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude to lift vp thy ſoule to her naturall pitch; shevv her that shee is immortall and heire of eternity, and teach her to direct her courſe that vvay: ô my faire &amp; louely ſoule; thou canſt vnderſtand and loue God himſelfe; vvhy then doſt thou entertaine thy ſelfe in things inferiour to God? thou maiſt pretend eternity and heauen for thy inheritance; vvhy then doſt thou hunt after moments and molehilis.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly that onely vertue and deuotion can make thy ſoule to reſt content in this vvorld, ô vvhat excellent beauty is in them?
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:200342:248"/>make a compariſon betvvixt the louely vertues, and the hideous vices that be contrary to them: vvhat ſvveetnes is there in patience, compared to reuenge? in meeknes, in reſpect of anger and frovvardnes? in humility, in regard of pride and ambition? in liberality, compared to couerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and nigardiſe? in charity, compared vvith enuie? in ſobriety, in reſpect of intemperance &amp;c. Vertues haue this excellency, that they fill the ſoule vvith an incomparable delight and ſvveetnes after she hath practiſed them: whereas vices leaue the ſoule exceedingly vvearied, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and moleſted. And vvhy endeauour vvee not then to obtaine theſe pleaſures, that haue no gall nor bitternes mingled vvith them? He that hath but a few vices, is not content vvith the delights they bring him; and he that hath many, is ouerburdoned by them, rent in ſunder by their croſſe and oppoſite inclinations; and finally, <hi>Laſſatus in via iniquitatis: vvearied in the vvay of iniquitie:</hi> but he that hath a few vertues, hath a great deale of content in them; and by a ſympathie and connexion of them; the more his contentment is, the more his vertues increaſe. O deuout and vertuous life, how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely art thou? how honourable? how delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Super omne aurum &amp; topazion? aboue all Gold and topazius?</hi> vvithout thee good is euill, and all pleaſures bitter vnquietnes.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to embrace a vertuous life for it's owne ſake, that is for the honour and content shee bringeth vvith her: proclaime a publike
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:200342:249"/>hatred to all ſorts of vice; and be not ashamed to profeſſe thy ſelfe a ſeruant and champion of vertue, as thy onely Miſtreſſe; cry alwayes to God vvith the Samaritane: <hi>Domine da mihi bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere de hac aqua, ſaliente in vitam aeternam.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider thirdly the examples of God's Saints of both ſexes and all conditions: vvhat is it, that they haue not done, and ſuffered for their loue and deuotion to God? looke vpon the inuincible Martyrs; vvhat torments haue they not conquered and ſcorned, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their faith, and performance of their loyalties? but aboue all, thoſe faire and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Ladies, vvhiter than lillies in purity, more blushing than roſes in charity, ſome at tvvelue, others at thirteene, fifteene and tvventy; ſee how they endured a thouſand ſorts of Martyrdomes, rather than to renounce their ſacred reſolutions not onely in profeſſion of faith, but alſo in the preſeruation of their virginity, and the exerciſe of other vertues. O good God, vvhat conſtancy, to our both comfort and confuſion, hath that fraile ſex shewed in theſe occaſions? Againe, ſee the millions of glorious Confeſſours, as vvell in Cities and the throng of worldlings, as in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries and deſerts: vvhat immoueable and vnconquered patience haue they shewed? how did they embrace their purpoſes of ſanctity vvithout exceptions or reſeruations, and went vvith them vvithout any tediouſneſſe or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:200342:249"/>neither thinke that they vvere by nature Angells or Seraphins, ſo to excuſe thy ſelfe: no, no, they vvere fraile, mortall men as vvee are: they did all for the ſame God and by the ſame vertues; and vvee haue the ſame Sacraments &amp; helpes, that they had.</p>
                  <p>Conclude then to re-aſſume a new courage and firme reſolution in the ſeruice of God and the vocation thou art placed in: vvhen any ſtorme ariſeth againſt thee, lift vp thine eyes to heauen, and ſee the valour of thoſe troupes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider fourthly the vnſpeakable loue, vvherewith Ieſus Chriſt our Lord ſuffered in the vvorld ſo much, eſpecially in the garden of mount Oliuet and the bitter place of mount Caluary: all that loue of his vvas for thy ſake; by theſe many pangs and torments he obtained of God the Father good purpoſes and holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions for thee: by the ſame afflictions did he moreouer purchaſe all things elſe neceſſarie for thy ſoule, to maintaine, nourish, ſtrengthen, &amp; bring vnto full growth and perfection all thy reſolutions. O ſee how the deare heart of our Lord Ieſus beheld thy heart from the tree of the Croſſe and there in a manner fell in loue vvith it; and for loue of it obtained for thee all the good that euer thou hadſt, or euer shalt haue; &amp; amongſt the reſt, theſe good reſolutions. O holy reſolution! how pretious and nobly borne art thou, being daughter to ſuch parents, as are the loue &amp; paſſion of thy ſweeteſt Sauiour? ô how
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:200342:250"/>carefully ought my ſoule to cherish thee, ſince thou haſt been ſo deare vnto my Jeſus? Alas, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of my ſoule, thou did'ſt die vpon the Croſſe to gaine me my vertuous reſolutions ah, doe me the fauour that J alſo chuſe rather to die, than to forget or forgoe thee or them.</p>
                  <p>Conclude to doe ſo by the grace of God: looke hereafter vpon thy good purpoſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions not as on creatures of thy owne braine, ſubject euery houre to new change and mutability: but as on the deareſt darlings of thy Sauiour's breaſt; and as ſuch eſteeme, honour and maintaine them; <hi>Et ducent te in vitam aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam. And they vvill lead thee to life euerlasting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider fifthly, how as a woman, as ſoone as she is vvith child, prepareth her cradle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linnen, ſwathing bands, and vvith all bethin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her ſelfe of a nurſe for her child, vvhich shee hopeth to bring forth, although it be not yet come into the world: euen ſo our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, hauing his goodnes pregnant and, as it were, great vvith child of thee, pretending to bring thee forth to ſaluation, and to make thee his daughter and heire, prepared vpon the holy Rood of the Croſſe all that vvas neceſſary for thee, and for thy ſaluation; that is, all the wayes, all the graces, all the fauours, by vvhich he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducteth thy ſoule, and vvill bring it at length to perfection. Ah my God! how deeply ought wee to imprint this in our memorie is it poſſible that I haue been loued, &amp; ſo ſweetly beloued by my Sauiour, that euery ſtep of his life &amp; paſſion,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:200342:250"/>euen as he vvent to mount Caluary, ſweating and fainting vnder his heauy Croſſe, euen then he went bethinking himſelfe of my good and of euery one of theſe little occaſions by which he hath drawne mee vnto him? how much ought vvee then to eſteeme and how carefully to imploy all this to our owne benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity? neither vvas this care of his for thee <hi>in generall</hi> or <hi>In confuſo;</hi> but ſo particularly, as though there had been no other ſoule in the vvorld to take care of: this made his Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Ipſe dilexit me, &amp; dedit ſemetipſum pro me. He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me, and gaue himſelfe for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude to be euer very vigilant &amp; carefull to attend, entertaine, and follow euery illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in ſpiration or motion to good, vvhich thy Jeſus shall dart into thy boſome: and craue hearty pardon for thy negligence hitherto in this point, vvhich importeth as much as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all our good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſidet ſixthly vvith an eſpeciall ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gratitude the firſt ſpring and originall ſource of all thy good, temporall and eternall; to vvit, the infinite and eternall loue that thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God beareth towards thee: for thou muſt know and for certaine beleeue that long before our Lord Ieſus Chriſt as man ſuffered for thee vpon the Croſſe, the diuine Maieſty did forecaſt thee in his all-ſeeing knowledge, and loued thee infinitely in his ſoueraigne goodnes. But vvhen, my ſoule, began this ſo great, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſo ancient a loue? ſure long before J was
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:200342:251"/>for it gaue me my firſt being; and ſo it is moſt free and franke, vvithout any deſert of mine: againe, long before earth, heauen, Angells and all other creatures; for being shut vp in the breaſt of God, it muſt be of equall durance vvith him; that is euery vvay as eternall as he himſelfe is. <hi>O antiqua veritas quàm ſerò te cognoui! ô aeterna bonitas, quàm ſerò te amaui! O ancient veritie, hovv late haue I knovvne thee! ô eternall goodneſſe, hovv late haue I loued thee!</hi> This loue then of God it vvas, that from all eternity vvas preparing, firſt my being, and then all other graces and fauours conducing to my vvell being and future ſaluation: among vvhich the firſt were holy inſpirations, and by them pious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and reſolutions to good: vvithout which nothing goeth forvvard <hi>In vitam aeternam. Tovvards euerlasting life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclude to make great eſteeme of thy good purpoſes, as coming from the fountaine of goodnes: know that all the vvorld is not worth one ſoule, and a ſoule is vvorth nothing without good reſolutions; leaue not then one good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for all the vvorld. Laſtly repay, how late ſoeuer, that loue of thy ſweeteſt God with one dramme of true loue.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider laſtly &amp; making a ſinall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the vvhole yeare paſt, and a ſtrong reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for the yeare to come; thinke and ſay; ô moſt amiable reſolutions! you are to mee the beautifull tree of life, vvhich my God hath planted vvith his ovvne hand in the midſt of my
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:200342:251"/>heart, and my Redeemer hath vvatered vvith his precious bloud, to make it fructifie: rather vvill J ſuffer a thouſand deaths than endure that one of you should be hindered. Neither vanity, nor delights, nor riches, nor ſorrowes, nor tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, shall euer, by God's grace, be able to pull me from my holy deſignes and purpoſes. O my good Lord, is it thou that haſt planted this tree of good reſolutions, and from Eternity kept it in the boſome of thy fatherly prouidence, to place it at length in the garden of my ſoule? ô hovv many ſoules are there vvhich haue not been fauoured in ſo high a degree? &amp; how then shall I be able to humble my ſelfe profoundly enough vnder thy mercy? ô beautifull and holy reſolutions? if I keepe charity, you vvill ſaue me eternally: if you liue ſtill in my ſoule, my ſoule vvill liue in you: liue then for euer my good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, as you vvere eternally in the mercy of my God, liue and remaine eternally in mee, and I in you. <hi>Amen Ieſu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This done, deliuer vp, conſecrate &amp; ſacrifice vnto God thy heart, thy ſoule, thy will, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, that thou vvilt neuer aske or demand them againe, but leaue them entirely and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in his holy hands; inuoke his grace to ſeale vp the contract: begge the aſſiſtance of the B.

                  <head>A MEDITATION FOR SCHOLERS that come to be admitted.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnſider firſt, that God almighty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee, as all things elſe, of nothing; not for any need he had of thee, or commodity by thee, but onely to exerciſe and declare his bounty in thee: and this he hath done in a moſt ample manner, making thee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of his grace and glory; and therefore he hath enriched thee with vnderſtanding to know him, memory to be mindfull of him, vvill to loue him; finally, vvith interiour and exteriour ſenſes, to feele, ſee and enjoy his benefits; of vvhich the vvhole vvorld is full, and for all vvhich thou art bound to praiſe him and ſerue him. The end therefore of thy Creation being to ſerue God in this vvorld and to enjoy him in the next; reflect a litle vpon thy ſelfe, how thou haſt complyed vvith the firſt part of ſeruing God: vpon what thou haſt hitherto buſied thy vnderſtanding, thy memory, thy vvill, with all the powers and ſenſes of thy ſoule and body: how little or how much thou haſt performed herein thy owne conſcience vvell examined will tell thee: but ſurely the common courſe of moſt men in the world, is ſo to liue as though they knew not by vvhom, nor for vvhat end they vvere created; vnles it were to enjoy theſe preſent pleaſures, &amp; to ſet vp their finall reſt in this vvorld; to heape vp riches; build faire
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:200342:253"/>houſes and vvallow in ſenſuall pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Conclude vvith moſt humble thankes to the Diuine goodnes, firſt, for creating thee to ſo noble an end; ſecondly, for giuing thee this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſee and review thy actions &amp; obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: reſolue hence forward, to reject and deſpiſe all thoughts and actions that conduce not to this end of ſeruing God: finally offer one hearty prayer to God for poore and blind world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider ſecondly the enormity of ſinne and terrour of death. <hi>Nam per peccatum mors: For by ſinne cometh death:</hi> ſinne is a more vgly monſter than the Deuill, and farre more hatefull to God: Jt vvas ſinne onely that threw the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells out of heauen, man out of Paradiſe &amp; both into hell; twas ſinne onely that made the Sonne of God giue vp his ſecred breath vpon the Croſſe; finally 'tis ſinne that vvill at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the vvhole world vvith fire and brimſtone. This being moſt true, ſee now how long it is ſince thou haſt begun to ſinne; and how euer ſince thou haſt increaſed them againſt God, thy neighbour, and thy ſelfe: ſweeteſt God, that I cannot preſent thee one day of all my life, in vvhich I haue not offended thee! not one of the powers of my ſoule, or ſenſes of my body free from the guilt of Sinne! not one of thy benefits, inſpirations or Sacraments, but J haue abuſed &amp; turned againſt thee! After ſinne comes death, vnpoſſible to be either preuented or foreſeen; &amp; yet moſt terrible; firſt, for being the laſt period

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:200342:254"/>for euer, without end, as long as God shall be God. O Eternity, how intolerable, how full of deſperation is thy memory to theſe wretches?
